Increased forecasting accuracy facilitates handling energy imbalances between generation and consumption. It also supports Smart Grid framework processes, such as Demand-Side or Demand Response Management (DRM). This paper presents a novel approach for One-Step-Ahead Energy Load Forecasting (OSA-ELF), considering several techniques. It utilizes historical data from a state-of-the-art nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) smart home, performing multiple tests for improved ELF. It focuses on OSA aspects of ELF, yet it can be utilized regardless of the time resolution. It predicts the \u201cnext step\u201d value, regardless of the step\u2019s duration (15-minutes, one-hour, one-day etc.) with high accuracy, and can be used for a wide variety of forecasting applications.

One major concern in carpooling services is related to trust, as carpooling users need to either share their vehicles, if they act as drivers, or travel with strangers if they act as passengers. One way to tackle trust concerns is the utilization of user reputation assessment mechanisms, whose objective is to provide ranking of users with respect to their behavior, based on feedback provided by other users. This paper presents a newly introduced reputation assessment mechanism for carpooling applications, which, in addition to feedback provided by other users, takes into account user travel preferences.

            "Abstract": "Biometrics have long been used as means to recognize people, mainly in terms of their physiological characteristics, for various commercial applications ranging from surveillance and access control against potential impostors to smart interfaces (Qazi (2004))(Xiao (2005)). These systems require reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services. The biometric methods, that are usually incorporated in such systems, can be categorized to physiological and behavioral (Jain et al.(2004)), depending on the type of used features. The most popular physiological biometric traits are the fingerprint (Maltoni et al.(2009)) that is widely used in law enforcement for identifying criminals, the face (Chang et al.(2005)) and the iris (Sun & Tan (2009)). However, despite their high recognition performance, static biometrics have been recently overwhelmed by the new generation of biometrics, which tend to cast light on more natural ways for recognizing people by analyzing behavioural traits. Specifically, behavioural biometrics are related to specific actions and the way that each person executes them. In other words, they aim at recognizing livingness, as it is expressed by dynamic traits. The most indicative cases of behavioural biometric recognition is gait (Goffredo et al.(2009b)), facial expressions (Liu & Chen (2003)) or other activity related, habitual traits (Drosou, Ioannidis, Moustakas & Tzovaras (2010)). As a result behavioural biometrics have become much more attractive to researchers due to their significant recognition potential and their unobtrusive nature. They can potentially allow the \u2026",

During the modeling phase an ontology is constructed with instances for each class of objects (animals, humans etc.), which contain semantic information about the parts constituting them. Geometric descriptors are then assigned to each part. During the recognition phase, the objects are segmented and geometrical descriptors are extracted for each segment. Finally, these geometric descriptors are compared to the descriptors of each of the instance parts, dissimilarity metrics are calculated and the object is classified to the class, which minimizes this metric.

The key issue to facilitate organization of services, taking into account their semantics, is the development of automatic mechanisms that generate appropriate mappings between Web service elements and their semantics\u2010enabled counterparts. In this paper, we introduce an ontology\u2010based mechanism for automatic semantic categorization of WS and their structural components. The presented approach, as opposed to similar ones, takes into account the lexicographic, structural, and data type characteristics of WS. Moreover, a software tool that implements the proposed service categorization mechanism is presented, and a benchmark process is executed that reveals outstanding performance of the developed mechanism in comparison with a relevant state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art approach \u2026",

Most of the FEM approaches exhaustively search for frequent patterns, while using a threshold to efficiently reduce the search space. While this approach provides efficient results in small datasets, it fails in large datasets due to heavy processing, which leads to low performance. This paper, proposes a fast frequent episode mining method which utilizes Finite-State Machines (FSM). Initially, a FSM is created based on a subset of the data, in order to approximate the type and frequency of the most dominant episodes. Instead of applying traditional exhaustive search procedures, the parsing of the dataset is herein guided by the proposed FSM approach. Experimental results show that the \u2026",

Investing on that notion, this manuscript employs virtual power plant (VPP) principles to deliver a novel, distributed, multi-agent virtual node scheme that aggregates consumers and prosumers and handles automatically OpenADR compliant DR requests. The introduced virtual node can act both as a virtual end node (VEN) receiving signals from a higher level (i.e., aggregator or utility) and/or as a virtual top node (VTN), dispatching optimal DR requests to customers. The proposed framework increases the DR results by not only optimally exploiting aggregated flexibility, but also through a dynamic bi-directional DR matchmaking process that can either recover \u2026",

The paper at hand proposes a local obstacle detection algorithm based on a fast stereo vision processing step, integrated with a dynamic path planner to avoid the detected obstacles in real-time, while simultaneously keeping track of the global path. It considers a robot-trailer articulated system, based on which the trailer trace should cover the entire operational space in order to perform a dedicated application. This is achieved by exploiting a model predictive controller to keep track of the trailer path while performing stereo vision-based local obstacle detection. A global path is initially posed that ensures full coverage of the operational space and during robot\u2019s motion, the detected obstacles are reported in the robot\u2019s occupancy grid map, which is considered from a hybrid global and local planner approach to avoid them locally. The developed algorithm has been evaluated in a simulation environment and proved adequate performance.",

To address this issue, we designed and developed a Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification of stress levels during exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to the therapist as an aggregated value (ranging from 0 to 1) and graphically displayed on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a webbased interface.",

Advanced ICT systems have been made available in the last decades and have been employed already in commercial energy markets. As more and more hardware and software solutions are flooding the market, the need for interoperability among systems has become a necessity. Building upon OpenADR, a well-known standard for DR, this work presents its semantic enrichment towards transforming it into an ontology (publicly available), which ultimately enables semantic interoperability among various DR stakeholders and systems and other semantic-related features like data validation, reusing terms and integration with other standard ontologies.

The project brought together 20 partners from nine countries with the goal of integrating into a common ICT platform a range of technologies intended to assist community-dwelling older people with cognitive impairment. The majority of technologies existed prior to INLIFE and a key goal was to bring them together in one place along with a number of new applications to provide a comprehensive set of services. The range of INLIFE services fell into four broad areas: Independent Living Support, Travel Support, Socialization and Communication Support and Caregiver Support. These included security applications, services to facilitate interactions with formal and informal caregivers, multilingual conversation support, web-based physical exercises, teleconsultations, and support for transport navigation. In total, over 2900 people participated in the project; they included elderly adults with cognitive impairment, informal caregivers, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders. The aim of the study was to assess whether there was improvement/stabilization of cognitive/emotional/physical functioning, as well as overall well-being and quality of life of those using the INLIFE services, and to assess user acceptance of the platform and individual services. The results confirm there is a huge interest and appetite for technological services to support older adults living with cognitive impairment in the community. Different services attracted different amounts of use and evaluation with some proving extremely popular while others less so. The \u2026",

After the decomposition of a 3D object's volume into a set of planes, the 2D polar wavelet transform is applied to each of them, generating a set of 2D rotation invariant features. These features comprise the input to the spherical trace transform for the final descriptor extraction, which is used for the shape matching. The 2D wavelet transform demonstrated experimentally a high discriminative power, as compared to other existing methods.",

The proposed assessment of the robotic functionalities are based on end-user perception of attractiveness, usability and potential societal impact of the device. The methods of evaluation applied consist of User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), AttrakDiff and the societal impact inventory tailored for the project purposes. The prototype version of the Robotic Assistant for MCI patients at Home (RAMCIP) was tested in a semi-controlled environment at the Department of Neurology (Lublin, Poland). 18 elderly participants, 10 healthy and 8 MCI, performed everyday tasks and functions facilitated by RAMCIP. The tasks consisted of semi-structuralized scenarios like: medication intake, hazardous events prevention, and social interaction. No differences between the groups of subjects were observed in terms of perceived attractiveness, usability nor societal impact of the device. The robotic assistant societal impact and attractiveness were highly assessed. The usability of the device was reported as neutral due to the short time of interaction.",

Over the past few years it has seen a rapid growth, both in terms of research and commercial usage. Due to its decentralized nature and its inherent use of cryptography, Blockchain provides an elegant solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem and is thus a good candidate for use in areas that require a decentralized consensus among untrusted peers, eliminating the need for a central authority. Internet of Things is a technology paradigm where a multitude of small devices, including sensors, actuators and RFID tags, are interconnected via a common communications medium to enable a whole new range of tasks and applications. However, existing IoT installations are often vulnerable and prone to security and privacy concerns. This paper studies the use of Blockchain to strengthen the security of IoT networks through a resilient, decentralized mechanism for the connected home that enhances the network self-defense by safeguarding critical security-related data. This mechanism is developed as part of the Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) project.",

In this paper, a completely different approach is followed: Instead of extracting features from the 3D object, its shape\u2019s\" impact\" on the surrounding area is examined. This impact is expressed by considering the 3D object voxels as electric point charges and computing the resulting electrostatic field in a neighborhood around it. The proposed approach ensures robustness with respect to object\u2019s degeneracies and native invariance under rotation and translation. Experiments which were performed in a 3D object databases proved that the proposed method can be efficiently used for 3D object retrieval applications.

After studying the potentiality of using modern AR elements in a museum context, this paper proposes the use of additional game and educational elements in the core AR application in order to enhance the overall on-the-spot museum visitor\u2019s experience. An agile AR application design methodology was followed by taking into account the needs of small-to-medium sized real-world museums. Moreover, a heuristic evaluation protocol was applied by a group of experts in order to test the proof-of-concept AR application, in which some novel elements were proposed such as the AR quiz game. The main findings indicate that enhanced AR experiences in museum settings can make a nice fit with the user environment, physical and perceptual abilities, known metaphors, and user position and motion in 3D space. Moreover, AR services can be provided under a minimum distraction and physical effort. As a conclusion, AR technologies are mature enough to be standardized for museum usage, while the audience seems to be ready to take advantage of the related enhanced museum experiences to maximize both user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

The field is described using both Newton's and general relativity's laws. In the Newtonian approach, histograms of the field values in the surrounding area of the 3D object are computed, while in the relativistic approach the descriptors are histograms of the time\u2013space curvature in the surrounding area of the 3D object.

            "Abstract": "Accurate building thermal output determination is key for the development of energy use optimisation strategies, including demand response strategies. The analysis of thermal images of buildings presents the opportunity to estimate energy demand based on the actual as-built buildings, as opposed to the current assessment procedures used in the industry which are based on design values. In this work, we present an image processing pipeline for calculating the thermal output of buildings, by identifying regions of interest given a dual modality (visible spectrum/RGB, infrared) input. The region of interest is assumed to be a building found approximately at the centre of the image field of view ('target building'). The visible spectrum/RGB input is first used to determine the position and outline of the target building in the field of view, and create a pixel-level binary mask with non-zero mask elements corresponding to the target. Subsequently, the produced mask is used to binarize the thermal imaging input and produce an intensity matrix containing only values that correspond only to the building/region of interest. With the proposed method, we are able to take into account only the thermal output of the region of interest, leaving out other image objects and other elements that act as' noise'in this context. Once computed, the thermal signature of the target building can be subsequently used as input to an energy auditing process or as a component of urban energy planning. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on dual RGB/synthetic thermal image pairs captured on various buildings.",

Geometric gait analysis is based on Radon transforms and on gait energy images. User height and stride length information is extracted and utilized in a probabilistic framework for the detection of soft biometric features of substantial discrimination power.

            "Abstract": "The recent development of novel powerful sensor topologies, namely Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) antennas, gave a thrust to the modeling of underground environment. An important step towards underground modelling is the detection of the typical hyperbola patterns on 2D images (B-scans), formulated due to the reflections of underground utilities. This work introduces a soil-agnostic approach for hyperbola detection, starting from one dimensional GPR signals, viz. A-scans, to perform a segmentation of each trace into candidate reflection pulses. Feature vector representations are calculated for segmented pulses through multilevel DWT decomposition. A theoretical geometric model of the corresponding hyperbola pattern is generated on the image plane for all point coordinates of the area under inspection. For each theoretical model, measured pulses that best support it are extracted and are utilized to validate it with a novel hybrid measure. The novel measure simultaneously controls the geometric plausibility of the examined hyperbola model and the consistency of the pulses contributing to this model across all the examined A-scan traces. Implementation details are discussed and experimental evaluation is exhibited on real GPR data.",

Our approach demonstrates that it is possible to get semantically meaningful features from images with text without using optical character recognition and sequential processing pipelines, techniques that traditional Natural Language Understanding algorithms require. To validate our approach, we present results for two applications: text classification and dialog modeling. Using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network, we were able to outperform the state-of-art accuracy results of non-Latin alphabet-based text classification and achieved promising results for eight text classification datasets. Furthermore, our approach outperformed the memory networks when using out of vocabulary entities fromtask 4 of the bAbI dialog dataset.",

Standard keypoint descriptors employ single-channel input gradients, thereby discarding potentially useful content. The proposed descriptor is based on a quaternionic representation of the input image thereby treating each pixel multispectral value holistically. Coupled with a suitable multispectral quaternionic detector, we show that the proposed detector leads to superior experimental results on a keypoint matching scenario.",

The interface provides an effortless way for the surgeon to generate a preoperative protocol for the surgery, while the knowledge base adds semantic information and rules to the surgery-specific ontologies. The surgeon can either modify a pre-existing prototype workflow for a known type of R-A MIS surgery or create a completely new surgical workflow for unknown types of R-A MIS. The workflow consists of phases and steps in consecutive order, incorporating anatomies, instruments and actions that the surgeon can modify. Any modification adheres to the rules of the knowledge base where information of incorporated robotic interactions is included. The interface is built as a web application that can be operated through a computer or portable device. The \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Inevitably, the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has alerted the modern human life. Apart from the benefits that this new technology offers to the users of the IoT devices, there are also dangers related to Cyber Security. Traditional methodologies that support and strengthen the Cyber Security can not be applied to the low consumption IoT devices. Hence, many attack detection methodologies and systems that respect the constraints of the IoT have been presented recently. In this paper, an anomaly detection mechanism is proposed that focuses on the threat detection, by combining statistical and machine learning methodologies to detect abnormalities in time-series of the network traffic. Moreover, this new framework is a lightweight Cyber Security solution, since its computational logic is included in the edge layer. The results of the experiments that were conducted in a test bed, indicated the high performance \u2026",

Initially, salient features are extracted for both the query range image and the 3-D target model. The concept behind the proposed algorithm is that, for a 3-D object and a corresponding query range image, there should be a virtual camera with such intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that would generate an optimum range image, in terms of minimizing an error function that takes into account the salient features of the objects, when compared to other parameter sets or other target 3-D models. In the context of the developed framework, a novel method is also proposed to hierarchically search in the parameter space for the optimum solution. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach even in the presence of noise or occlusion.",

            "Abstract": "Non-linear deformations are useful for applications where users face highly cluttered visual displays, either due to large datasets, or visualizations on small screens, or a combination of both, that increases the density of the data and makes the perception of patterns difficult. Non-linear deformations have been used to magnify significant/cluttered regions in data visualization, for the purpose of reducing clutter and enhancing the perception of patterns. General deformation methods (eg logarithmic scaling and fish-eye views) suffer from several drawbacks, since they do not consider the prominent features that must be preserved in the visualization. This work introduces a hierarchical approach for non-linear deformation that aims to reduce visual clutter by magnifying significant regions, and lead to enhanced visualizations of two/three-dimensional datasets on highly cluttered displays. The proposed approach utilizes an energy function, which aims to determine the optimal deformation for every local region in the data, taking the information from multiple single-layer significance maps into account. The problem is subsequently transformed into an optimization problem for the minimization of the energy function under specific spatial constraints. The proposed hierarchical approach for the generation of the significance map, surpasses current methods, and manages to efficiently identify significant regions and achieve better results.",

However, there is demand for more specific modules embodied in cognitive architecture that will detect abnormal cognitive decline across new synthetic task environments. Also, accessibility evaluation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) requires considerable effort for enhancing ICT products accessibility for older adults. The main aim of this study is to develop and test virtual user models (VUM) simulating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through novel specific modules, embodied at cognitive models and defined by estimations of cognitive parameters. Well-established MCI detection tests assessed users\u2019 cognition, elaborated their ability to perform multitasks, and monitored the performance of infotainment related tasks to provide more accurate simulation results on existing conceptual frameworks and enhanced predictive validity in interfaces\u2019 design supported by increased tasks\u2019 complexity to capture a more detailed profile of users\u2019 capabilities and limitations.

Taking into account recommendation services through mobile applications, this paper proposes a more dynamic and occupant-centered solution, which not only offers useful energy related recommendations, but also adjusts the moment the recommendation is sent to maximize the receptiveness of the user in order to achieve the optimal energy behavior change.

After proper positioning of the 3D objects using translation and scaling, a set of functionals is applied to the 3D model producing a new domain of concentric spheres. In this new domain, a new set of functionals is applied, resulting in a descriptor vector which is completely rotation invariant and thus suitable for 3D model matching. Further, weights are assigned to each descriptor, so as to significantly improve the retrieval results. Experiments on two different databases of 3D objects are performed so as to evaluate the proposed method in comparison with those most commonly cited in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior in terms of precision versus recall and can be used for 3D model search and retrieval in a highly efficient manner.",

Then, 3D information is propagated in a spatial neighbourhood, until similarity reaches a predefined threshold, to cover a semi-dense portion of operating field domain. Matching on dense level is achieved with Zero Mean Normalized Cross Correlation metric to establish correspondences.

In the context of the theory of journalism 3.0, where multimedia data can be extracted from different sources on the web, the possibility of creating a tool for the exploitation of Earth observation (EO) data, especially images by professionals belonging to the field of journalism, is explored. With the production of massive volumes of EO image data, the problem of their exploitation and dissemination to the public, specifically, by professionals in the media industry, arises. In particular, the exploitation of satellite image data from existing tools is difficult for professionals who are not familiar with image processing. In this scope, this article presents a new innovative platform that automates some of the journalistic practices. This platform includes several mechanisms allowing users to early detect and receive information about breaking news in real-time, retrieve EO Sentinel-2 images upon request for a certain event, and automatically generate a personalized article according to the writing style of the author. Through this platform, the journalists or editors can also make any modifications to the generated article before publishing. This platform is an added-value tool not only for journalists and the media industry but also for freelancers and article writers who use information extracted from EO data in their articles.

Orchestration of large hybrid human-robot teams carrying out many tasks in parallel within a shop floor faces new challenges due to unique aspects introduced by HRC. This paper presents a new approach to topological and temporal orchestration of hybrid human-robot workforce, considering the capabilities of robot agents as well as the potentially new roles that human operators may acquire in an HRC setting. We propose a two-stage approach to orchestrating large HRC teams: First, an abstract topological and task assignment problem is solved, which does not consider the precise sequence of tasks. Second, the result of the first step is used to initialize a constrained search for an efficient HRC schedule. Initial application of the proposed \u2026",

In this interaction technique, haptic and virtual modalities are combined together in order to enhance user experiences for multiple users: a normal sighted person is able to normally interact with the virtual reality scene by direct manipulation, a blind person is able to interact with the virtual reality scene by sensing and acting on the hapgets, a person having a small visual impairment benefits from the haptic feedback to reinforce the visual channel. A small toolkit of hapgets is described and used in some examples. Each hapget is also specified in UsiXML, a XML-compliant User Interface Description Language that supports model-driven engineering of user interfaces. In this way, any UsiXML-compatible user interface can be rendered thanks to any traditional user interface interpreter as well as through HaptiXML, a special rendering engine that has been developed for this purpose.",

The aim of this feasibility study was to assess whether inflammatory status of the LVs and/or changes in the miRNA profile of the LVs have potential prognostic and predictive value for overall outcome and risk of relapse. Samples of macroscopically normal human lymph LVs (n = 10) were isolated from the external iliac vessels draining the pelvic region of patients undergoing debulking surgery. This was followed by quantification of the inflammatory state (low, medium and high) and presence of cancer-infiltration of each LV using immunohistochemistry. LV miRNA expression profiling was also performed, and analysed in the context of high versus low inflammation, and cancer-infiltrated versus non-cancer-infiltrated. Results were correlated with clinical outcome data including relapse with an average follow-up time of 13.3 months. The presence of a high degree of inflammation correlated significantly with patient relapse (p = 0.033). Cancer-infiltrated LVs showed a moderate but non-significant association with relapse (p = 0.07). Differential miRNA profiles were identified in cancer-infiltrated LVs and those with high versus low inflammation. In particular, several members of the let-7 family were consistently down-regulated in highly inflamed LVs (>1.8-fold, p<0.05) compared to the less inflamed ones. Down-regulation of the let-7 family appears to be associated with inflammation, but whether inflammation contributes to \u2026",

Then, for each block affected by blocking artifacts, its DC and AC coefficients are recalculated for artifact reduction. To achieve this, a closed-form representation of the optimal correction of the DCT coefficients is produced by minimizing a novel enhanced form of the mean squared difference of slope for every frequency separately.

This paper proposes a method which employs a hierarchical structure of Hidden Markov Models (Layered HMMs) in an attempt to exploit inherent characteristics of human action for more efficient recognition. The case study concerns actions of the arms of a seated subject and depends on the assumption of a static office environment. The first layer of HMMs detects short, primitive motions with direct targets, while every upper layer processes the previous layer inference to recognize abstract actions of longer time granularities. The problem of unsupervised learning within the LHMM framework is also addressed, through automatic segmentation of raw data and hierarchical clustering of motion samples. Finally, the idea of context-aware HMM modeling is also introduced and future directions for its application are proposed. The results demonstrate the efficiency, the tolerance on noise interpolation and the high degree of person-invariance of the method.",

However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind.

After proper positioning of the 3D structures, in terms of translation and scaling, the spherical trace transform is applied to them so as to produce geometry-based descriptor vectors, which are completely rotation invariant and perfectly describe their 3D shape. Additionally, characteristic attributes of the primary and secondary structure of the protein molecules are extracted, forming attribute-based descriptor vectors. The descriptor vectors are weighted and an integrated descriptor vector is produced. Three classification methods are tested. A part of the FSSP/DALI database, which provides a structural \u2026",

On the other hand, a patient falling from bed can cause serious damage to his health state, while the effect of pressure ulcers can be avoided by timely and accurate mapping of pressure points that inhibit tissue perfusion resulting in death. Recent technological advances and scientific achievements have introduced new and improved medical devices using highly-developed embedded control functions and interactivity.

The abundance of raw data necessitates the use of data analytics in order to extract useful patterns for decision making. Current architectures for big data analytics in the IoT domain address the large volume and velocity of the produced data. However, they do not address the semantic heterogeneity in the data models used by diverse IoT platforms, which emerges when large-scale deployments, spanning across multiple deployment sites, are considered. This paper proposes an architecture for big data analytics in the context of large-scale IoT systems consisting of multiple IoT platforms. A Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) handles the interoperability among the data models of the individual platforms, using semantic mappings between them and a unified ontology. Data queries to the SIL and result collection is handled by a cloud-based data management layer, namely the Data Lake, along with storage of metadata needed by data analytics methods. Based on this infrastructure, webbased data analytics and visual analytics methods are used to analyze the collected data, while being agnostic of platform-specific details. The proposed architecture is developed in the context of healthcare provision for older people, although it can be applied to any IoT domain.",

HCRFs are used to directly link a set of observations to the most appropriate activity label and as such to discriminate high risk activities (e.g. trespassing) from zero risk activities (e.g loitering outside the perimeter).

Services of the same or different application areas, after being mapped to ontological concepts, will be able to be integrated in the main ontological framework, thus being ready to be used seamlessly through the CCM. The tool also enables modifications to the mapped concepts, using easy-to-use drag-and-drop functionality. In addition, CCM will offer ready made taxonomies for elderly people needs, thus making simpler for the developers to embed the extra functionality into their services. This innovative feature, compared to the ASK-IT Data Management Module, will realize the automatic integration of new services in the context of the OASIS ontological framework, by the development of mechanisms that support automatic code generation and on-the-fly reconstruction of the back-end functionality. The purpose of the CCM back-end is to orchestrate connections between the user interface through the ambient intelligence environment and agent technology, as well as the core functionality of the OASIS System.

In this context new mechanisms are necessary for improving the overall accuracy of the semantic characterization process, preserving the overall performance at an acceptable level. Existing semantic categorization mechanisms take into account all tokens that are included in web service description documents thus resulting in poor performing categorization tasks. This paper demonstrates how a significant improvement in performance can be achieved by applying the Bayes' theorem for transforming the feature space in order to decrease its dimension, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluation of our approach with respect to other feature selection techniques shows that the former achieves better prediction accuracy, as well as \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Physical inactivity in children is a major public health challenge, for which valid physical activity assessment tools are needed. Wearable devices provide a means for objective assessment of children\u2019s physical activity, but they are often not adopted because of issues such as cost, comfort, and privacy. In this context, self-reporting tools could be employed, but their validity in relation to a child\u2019s age is understudied. We present the agreement of one of the most popular self-reporting tools, the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C) with accelerometer-measured physical activity in 9-year-old versus 12-year-old children, wearing an accelerometer-based wearable device for seven consecutive days. We study the relationship between the PAQ-C and accelerometer scores using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients and Bland\u2013Altman plots in a sample of 131 children included for analysis. Overall, there was correlation between PAQ-C score and physical activity measures for the 12-year-old children (rho= 0.47 for total physical activity, rho= 0.43 for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, rho= 0.41 for steps, p< 0.01), but not for the 9-year-old children (rho= 0.08 for total physical activity, rho= 0.21 for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, rho= 0.19 for steps, p> 0.05). All PAQ-C items other than item 3 (activity at recess) did not reach significance in correlation with accelerometry for the 9-year-old children (p> 0.05). Therefore, the use of wearable devices for more objective assessment of physical activity in younger children should be preferred. View Full-Text",

Three different types of occupancy information are considered: presence/absence, actual number of occupants and occupancy density. The proposed occupancy estimation method has been applied to four spaces with different characteristics in a real-life testbed environment. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method yielded high accuracy for different sensor combinations in all tested configurations regarding the occupancy granularity and the space type, and outperformed the Hidden Markov Model based method.",

The current paper proposes a novel approach for multi-variate data mining from past traffic data (ie average speed values per road), so as to dynamically detect all significant correlations between the road network components (ie the segments of the roads) by mapping the latter onto a low dimensional embedding. Multiple traffic-related features (eg speed correlation, spatial proximity, phase difference, etc.) are utilized in a multi-objective optimization framework, producing all Pareto-optimal embeddings, each one corresponding to a different trade-off between the objectives. The operator is provided with the option to interactively select among these Pareto-optimal solutions, so as to explore the most descriptive sets of road influences. The proposed method has been evaluated on real traffic data, while the evaluation of the forecasting performance of the multi-objective approach exhibited accuracy improvement with respect single-objective approaches.",

The energy production from these sources is not dispatchable, and the increasing penetration of RES in energy mixes may therefore lead to a progressive loss of generation control and predictability. It has become clear that, to reach higher RES penetration levels, it is essential to increase power system flexibility in order to ensure stable operations are maintained. An ICT (Information and Communication Technology) tool that may be used to manage and optimize the flexibility offered by energy storage and conversion systems is described in this paper with specific reference to the Decision Support System (DSS) developed within the H2020 PLANET (PLAnning and operational tools for optimizing energy flows and synergies between energy NETworks) project. The paper focuses on how the PLANET DSS tool evaluates, manages, and dispatches the flexibility of Power to Gas/Heat (P2X) technologies. Moreover, the tool has been used to analyze a realistic case in order to show how the PLANET DSS tool could be used to evaluate the energy and economic benefits of taking advantage of the flexibility of P2X technologies.

The proposed approach utilizes page segmentation techniques, along with an OCR engine, in order to acquire the text data and bounding boxes of each word in the document. These elements are then grouped in a bottom-up fashion, based on a series of rules, in order to identify and reconstruct tabular arrangements of data. Based on this methodology, an open source cross-platform tool capable of recognizing the semantic structure of documents containing tabular data has been implemented, thus widening the range of document types than can be successfully converted into alternative accessible formats, suitable for users with visual impairments.",

First, rigid scene objects are segmented and feature points in each object are extracted and tracked throughout the video sequence. Then, motion, structure and focal length are estimated recursively for each object, using extended Kalman filters, as described in Azarbayejani and Pentland (1995). Furthermore, the feature points and depths in the stereo image are computed and interpolated using 2-D Delaunay triangulation. Finally, a stereo image generation algorithm is proposed that uses the camera and structure equations to project the 3-D points in a new virtual stereo view for each frame. The generation of stereoscopic scenes is possible even when multiple moving rigid objects exist in the scene. Experimental results \u2026",

Their characteristics, and ultimately their function, depend on their three-dimensional (3D) structure; however, the procedures to experimentally determine it are extremely laborious and demanding. Hence, the ability to gain insight into the structure of Igs at large relies on the availability of tools and algorithms for producing accurate Ig structural models based on their primary sequence alone. These models can then be used to determine structural and eventually functional similarities between different Igs. An example of such a task is the clustering of Igs based on their structure to determine meaningful common features such as the possible existence of common molecular targets (antigens). Several approaches have been proposed in order to achieve an optimal \u2026",

            "Abstract": "On becoming a commodity, Microgrids (MGs) have started gaining ground in various sizes (eg, nanogrids, homegrids, etc.) and forms (eg, local energy communities) leading an exponential growth in the respective sector. From demanding deployments such as military bases and hospitals, to tertiary and residential buildings and neighborhoods, MG systems exploit renewable and conventional generation assets, combined with various storage capabilities to deliver a completely new set of business opportunities and services in the context of the Smart Grid. As such systems involve economic, environmental and technical aspects, their performance is quite difficult to evaluate, since there are not any standards that cover all of these aspects, especially during operational stages. Towards allowing an holistic definition of a MG performance, for both design and operational stages, this paper first introduces a complete set of Key Performance Indicators to measure holistically the performance of a MG\u2019s life cycle. Following, focusing on the MG\u2019s day-to-day operation, a data-driven assessment is proposed, based on dynamic metrics, custom made reference models, and smart meter data, in order to be able to extract its operational performance. Two different algorithmic implementations (ie, Dynamic Time Warping and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are used to support the methodology proposed, while real-life data are used from a small scale MG to provide the desired proof-of-concept. Both algorithms seem to correctly identify days and periods of not optimal operation, hence presenting promising results for MG performance assessment \u2026",

This paper at hand, focuses on building successfully semantic maps by combining spatial knowledge on the occupancy grid map with deep learning and computer vision techniques. The presented method exploits the vision based data captured by robot\u2019s perception system, to ease its installation in the operational environment.

We claim that the recognition capacity of various activities varies, according to the type of the activity and thus, we form an initial categorization to normal and abnormal activities. The collection of these biometric data is of high importance and thus, we suggest a dual approach to the anthropometrical tracking of the user, followed by a method for the intact extraction of invariant biometric features from the collected temporal data. The ethical issues risen from the collecting of personal data are thoroughly discussed. Possible applications and innovative usages of such behavioral biometrics are explored \u2026",

Our ultimate aim is to train a recurrent neural network to map the keyword sequence of a text to the entire text. Successive reformulations of the keyword and full-text word sequences are performed, so that they can serve as the input and target of the network as efficiently as possible. The predicted texts are understandable enough, and the model performance depends on the problem difficulty, determined by the percentage of full-text words that are considered as keywords, that ranges from 1/3 to 1/2 approximately, the training memory cost, mainly affected by the network architecture \u2026",

This paper proposes a novel integrated framework for offline task scheduling and resources assignment, which can be used in manufacturing industries. The proposed framework can be a part of an intelligent production system in an Industry 4.0 shop floor. For the creation of the work schedule referring to a time interval given a set of tasks and resources, such as workers and machines, multiple criteria are considered: execution restrictions, capabilities of resources, preferences, and past performance data. The main advantage of the scheduling framework is its potential to support adaptive and evolving decision-making based on feedback information received from various sources of the environment. Continuously updated data models that include the characteristics, requirements and performance metrics for each resource in a dynamic environment, as well as configuration settings and feedback provided by the manager, are taken into account in order to generate work schedules which can be efficient in terms of task-to-resource mapping and in accordance with manager\u2019s preferences and policies. The implementation requirements of the proposed framework along with an initial system towards the implementation of the framework are also presented in this paper.",

An efficient algorithm is initially proposed for decomposing the complex objects into subobjects suitable for superquadric modeling, based on visual salience and curvature constraints. The distance between the superquadrics and the mesh is then projected onto the superquadric surface, thus generating a distance map (SQ-Map). Approximate collision detection is then performed by computing the analytical equations and distance maps instead of triangle per triangle intersection tests. Collision response is then calculated directly from the superquadric models and realistic smooth force feedback is obtained using analytical formulae and local smoothing on the distance map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SQ-Map reduces \u2026",

            "Abstract": "3D CNN-based architectures have found application in a variety of 3D vision tasks, significantly outperforming earlier approaches. This increase in accuracy, however, has come at the cost of computational complexity, with deep learning models becoming more and more complex, requiring significant computational resources, especially in the case of 3D data. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of low power devices in various technology fields has shifted the research focus towards the implementation of deep learning on systems with limited resources. While plenty of approaches have achieved promising results in terms of reducing the computational complexity in 2D tasks, their applicability in 3D-CNN designs has not been thoroughly researched. The current work aims at filling this void, by investigating a series of efficient CNN design techniques within the scope of 3D-CNNs, in order to produce guidelines for 3D-CNN design that can be applied to already established architectures, reducing their computational complexity. Following these guidelines, a computationally efficient 3D-CNN architecture for human pose estimation from 3D data is proposed, achieving comparable accuracy to the state-of-theart. The proposed design guidelines are further validated within the scope of 3D object classification, achieving high accuracy results at a low computational cost.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper a building occupancy prediction method is presented, which is based on the spatio-temporal analysis of historical data (occupancy modelling) and further relies heavily on current contextual information, being therefore suitable for providing real-time prediction. Two different algorithmic approaches are proposed, based on Markov models, revealing how context awareness adds the capability of rapidly adjusting to current conditions and capturing unexpected events, as opposed to capturing only typical occupancy fluctuation expected on a regular basis. Both proposed approaches are evaluated against accurate real-life data collected from a tertiary building, achieving notable results which outperform currently used methods.",

Although several factors have been studied for their ability to indicate software security risk, very limited attention has been given to technical debt (TD), despite its potential relevance to software security. To this end, in the present study, we investigate the ability of common TD indicators to indicate security risks in software products, both at project-level and at class-level of granularity. Our findings suggest that TD indicators may potentially act as security indicators as well.",

The main idea of scale-and-stretch techniques is to utilize a single grid with predefined resolution, and map onto it the single significance map. The problem of image resizing is subsequently formulated as an optimization problem, which determines the optimal deformation for every local region of the image based on their underling significance. The use, however, of a single grid with specific distribution is not robust with respect to the size of the significant regions that exist in the image. In this respect, this paper extents the scale-and-stretch techniques with the use of a hierarchical grid that \u2026",

This paper at hand, focuses on building successfully semantic maps by combining spatial knowledge on the occupancy grid map with deep learning and computer vision techniques. The presented method exploits the vision based data captured by robot\u2019s perception system, to ease its installation in the operational environment. Unlike previous methods, the proposed one does not require any prior knowledge of the environment concerning the semantics of places, as it is semi-supervised and the labeling of the segmented areas is being performed manually after the process is completed.

Here, taking advantage of a large multi-institutional series, we aimed at obtaining insight into the ontogenetic relationship of MZ lymphoproliferations, related entities and CLL through cross-comparison of their B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) gene repertoires. Our sequence dataset included 3660 unique IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangement sequences from our collaborative centers and/or \u2026",

A flexible and scalable ICT solution architecture was proposed to support highly personalized and gamified services for all groups involved: cognitive skills training and independent living for PLWD, training and support for caregivers and high clinical and social services for professionals. The outcomes of this approach are delivered through a set of gamification concepts running in parallel to create motivation for user commitment and for achieving the desired behavioral change. After projecting all user group expectations on a social game canvas, the impact evaluation will assess the intended effects of the proposed gamification approach on the welfare on PLWD and their caregivers.",

            "Abstract": "As clouds increase in size and as machines of different types are added to the infrastructure in order to maximize performance and power efficiency, heterogeneous clouds are being created. However, exploiting different architectures poses significant challenges. To efficiently access heterogeneous resources and, at the same time, to exploit these resources to reduce application development effort, to make optimisations easier and to simplify service deployment, requires a re-evaluation of our approach to service delivery. We propose a novel cloud management and delivery architecture based on the principles of self-organisation and self-management that shifts the deployment and optimisation effort from the consumer to the software stack running on the cloud infrastructure. Our goal is to address inefficient use of resources and consequently to deliver savings to the cloud provider and consumer in terms of reduced power consumption and improved service delivery, with hyperscale systems particularly in mind. The framework is general but also endeavours to enable cloud services for high performance computing. Infrastructure-as-a-Service provision is the primary use case, however, we posit that genomics, oil and gas exploration, and ray tracing are three downstream use cases that will benefit from the proposed architecture.",

These mechanisms, although they enhance software security, they usually execute a large number of instructions, adding a performance/energy penalty to the overall application. Conversely, source code transformations are extensively performed by developers in order to improve the runtime quality of applications, in terms of performance and energy efficiency. These transformations may indirectly affect software security, since they may lead to the introduction of new security issues. In this work, we empirically examine the impact of source code-level energy/performance optimizations on software security and vice versa. The preliminary results of the empirical study suggest that the energy-related transformations may indirectly affect software security, whereas the incremental addition of security mechanisms may lead to an important increase in the energy consumption of software applications.",

            "Abstract": "A novel combined frequency and spatial domain method is presented in this paper for blockiness reduction for low bit rate compressed images. The method consists of two stages: in the first, better estimates of the reconstructed DCT coefficients are obtained based on their observed probability distribution. In the second, an efficient postprocessing scheme consisting of a region classification algorithm and a spatial adaptive filtering is applied for blockiness removal. The type of filtering is decided on the basis of an estimation of the local characteristics of the coded image. The main advantage of the proposed method is the efficient combination and design of these two stages which are acting complementarily for the reduction of blocking artifacts. This approach is shown to produce excellent results in removing blocking artifacts. The efficient performance of the proposed algorithm is due, firstly, to the proposition that the shape and the position of the filter kernel are adjusted according to the characteristics of the local image region and secondly, to the employment of the modified improved DCT coefficients by the postprocessing filter. Experimental results illustrating the performance of the proposed method are presented and evaluated.",

In particular, by estimating the distribution of the noise induced during the measurement of one or more soft biometric traits, the recognition score for a genuine user can be efficiently modelled as a conditional matching probability that takes into account both geometric and soft biometrics. Herein, the geometric traits are provided via a state-of-art 3D face recognition system, while the soft biometrics regard the distances between three facial nodal points (i.e. the eyes, the nose and the mouth). Experimental validation on a proprietary dataset of 54 subjects illustrates significant advances in both identification and authentication rates of the proposed method when compared to the 3D face recognition system.",

Over the past decade, rigorous research has produced significant results in optimally dispatching DR in an attempt to maximize flexibility extraction. However, the vast majority of works assumes a \u201chappy path\u201d scenario in which DR requests are always successfully completed. Hence, there is a large gap in the literature that fails to account for non-deterministic factors that manifest in practical deployments, e.g., the stochasticity of end-user behavior that can drastically influence the DR's outcomes. Investing on that notion, a novel, distributed, multi-agent system (MAS) that aggregates consumers and prosumers and \u2026",

Traffic congestion phenomena can be avoided by forecasting volume traffic data. This paper aims to analyze how specific factors and parameters affect the behavior of traffic volume, like vehicle category, date, and weather data at a given timestamp and place. Moreover, the procedure of data prepossessing is presented to produce a cleaner data set that gives more fundamental information. Subsequently, spatio-temporal toll road prediction is achieved through a multi-layer perceptron. Finally, the proposed low-cost method is evaluated using real-life data from a toll plaza, while the experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method.",

Point trajectories are robust under partial occlusions and allow the expansion of a track even in the absence of a detection.

This paper suggests a model that simulates traffic density at ports' gates into three levels: low, medium and high. Parameters that affect traffic density are clustered to strengthen potential relationship between them by using BIRCH algorithm. Furthermore, Gradient Boosting Algorithm is utilized to classify traffic volume into the three states while exploiting available historical data along with the clustered data. The aim is to propose a non-intrusive and inexpensive novel tool for traffic simulation based only on available port data while ensuring better quality of transportation particularly with regard to boarding time towards avoiding further delays. Finally, the proposed traffic simulation model is evaluated with real-time port data, while the experimental results have shown that it is a powerful tool for port traffic \u2026",

The biometric signature of the user is extracted, throughout the performance of a couple of common, every-day office activities. Specifically, the behavioral response of the user, stimuli related to an office scenario, such as the case of a phone conversation and the interaction with a keyboard panel is examined. The motion based, activity related, biometric features that correspond to the dynamic interaction with objects that exist in the surrounding environment are extracted in the enrollment phase and are used to train an HMM. The authentication potential of the proposed biometric features has been seen to be very high in the performed experiments. Moreover, the combination of the results of these two activities further increases the authentication rate. Extensive experiments carried out on the proprietary ACTIBIO-database verify this potential of activity related authentication within the proposed scheme.",

This paper proposes the introduction of novel enriched linguistic tests and examines the hypothesis that language can be a sensitive cognitive measure for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A group of MCI and healthy elderly were administered a set of proposed linguistic tests. Performance measures were made on both groups to indicate that concrete verbal production deficits such as impaired verb fluency can distinguish the MCI from normal aging. In addition, it was found that even in cases where the MCI subjects preserved scores, language tests took significantly more time compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that language could be a sensitive cognitive marker in preclinical stages of MCI.",

            "Abstract": "The analysis of the network traffic in 5G networks is of high significance to the network security administrator, since it could allow for the identification of different behavioural groups and the distinction of anomalous from normal activity. The problem is the multi-dimensional nature of the data, e.g. SMS, call, Internet, services etc. that makes it difficult to analyse. This is even more challenging in 5G networks, compared to previous generation networks, since one more dimension is added to the traffic, representing different network slices. In this respect, activity that is normal in one slice can be anomalous in another. This paper presents a graph-based method for network mining and visualization of user activities in a mobile network. The raw multi- dimensional network traffic data are used for the construction of multiple multi-dimensional graph- based features that capture specific behavioural aspects for each user \u2026",

            "Abstract": "As microgrids have gained increasing attention over the last decade, more and more applications have emerged, ranging from islanded remote infrastructures to active building blocks of smart grids. To optimally manage the various microgrid assets towards maximum profit, while taking into account reliability and stability, it is essential to properly schedule the overall operation. To that end, this paper presents an optimal scheduling framework for microgrids both for day-ahead and real-time operation. In terms of real-time, this framework evaluates the real-time operation and, based on deviations, it re-optimises the schedule dynamically in order to continuously provide the best possible solution in terms of economic benefit and energy management. To assess the solution, the designed framework has been deployed to a real-life microgrid establishment consisting of residential loads, a PV array and a storage unit. Results demonstrate not only the benefits of the day-ahead optimal scheduling, but also the importance of dynamic re-optimisation when deviations occur between forecasted and real-time values. Given the intermittency of PV generation as well as the stochastic nature of consumption, real-time adaptation leads to significantly improved results. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Human perception combines information from various sensors, including visual, aural, haptic, and olfactory, in order to perceive the environment. Virtual reality applications aim to immerse the user into a virtual environment by providing artificial input to its interaction sensors (ie, eyes, ears, hands). The visual and aural inputs are the most important factors in human-computer interaction (HCI). However, virtual reality applications will remain far from being realistic without providing to the user the sense of touch. The use of haptics augments the standard audio-visual HCI by offering to the user an alternative way of interaction with the VE. One of the major application branches of haptic-enabled virtual environments is medicine. In the following, the most important medical application areas are briefly presented and described.1. Echography examination is a nonintrusive technique in which the observation and examination of the organs such as the heart, liver, and spleen are achieved permitting the evaluation of the fetus for normal development as well as the blood flow through specific vessels. In many places, such as small hospitals and health centers, it is possible that echography-related equipment exists, but there are no experts able to perform the examinations. Typical cases include many small medical centers, isolated sites, or rescue vehicles, which do not have the appropriate well-trained sonographer to perform the initial echography for the evaluation of the emergency level (1).",

Challenges such as ambient noise, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and microphone distance are not yet fully understood. If the multimodal approaches are to become better in a range of fields of interest, audio analysis will have to play an integral part. Event recognition in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is such a field at a nascent stage that can especially leverage solely on audio or can be part of the multimodal approach. In this manuscript, an extensive analysis focused on the comparison of different magnitude representations of the raw audio is presented. The data on which the analysis is carried out is part of the publicly available MIVIA Audio Events dataset. Single channel Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), mel-scale and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) spectrogram representations are used. Furthermore, aggregation methods of the aforementioned spectrogram representations are examined; the feature concatenation compared to the stacking of features as separate channels. The effect of the SNR on recognition accuracy and the generalization of the proposed methods on datasets that were both seen and not seen during training are studied and reported. View Full-Text",

Training these models is a computationally intensive process due to the volume of available traffic data. Therefore, having effective methods for accelerating this process is considered necessary. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for accelerating the training process of multiple short-term traffic prediction models in large-scale traffic networks. In particular, the traffic data is organized into separate files so that the training process for one model is independent of the others. These files are distributed in the cores of a shared-memory multicore processor so as to train multiple models simultaneously. Appropriate measures have been taken to limit the memory footprint of the proposed method, as well as to enhance its load balancing capabilities. The proposed method was applied \u2026",

This chapter introduces a theoretical framework whose main contribution is twofold; the first one concerns a study on detecting user emotions during human\u2013robot interaction, and the second one concerns the translation of the detected user emotions, into short-term (eg half-hour) and long-term (eg daily-long) user mood estimates. Alongside, mappings are established between recognized user affect and effects on the robot\u2019s cognitive functions that drive the robot\u2019s assistive behaviour. This results into either the engagement of the service robot in some assistive intervention, aiming to induce more positive outlooks, eg stimulating a contact with relatives or friends, or modifications in the way that the robot provides assistance so as to induce a positive feeling of care to the user. Within this chapter, we also propose specific application scenarios of Ambient Assisted Living, on which the current theoretical study can be applied, enabling a service robot to adapt its assistive behaviour based on its user mood and emotions, enabling thus the user to maintain positive affect where possible.",

The proposed occupancy extraction system can be efficiently applied to multi-space environments using a privacy preserving multi-camera cloud. Statistics per building, space and occupant can be finally extracted by the system. The experimental results will illustrate its robustness, accuracy and efficiency on occupancy extraction.",

            "Abstract": "Air pollution is a widespread problem due to its impact on both humans and the environment. Providing decision makers with artificial intelligence based solutions requires to monitor the ambient air quality accurately and in a timely manner, as AI models highly depend on the underlying data used to justify the predictions. Unfortunately, in urban contexts, the hyper-locality of air quality, varying from street to street, makes it difficult to monitor using high-end sensors, as the cost of the amount of sensors needed for such local measurements is too high. In addition, development of pollution dispersion models is challenging. The deployment of a low-cost sensor network allows a more dense cover of a region but at the cost of noisier sensing. This paper describes the development and deployment of a low-cost sensor network, discussing its challenges and applications, and is highly motivated by talks with the local municipality and the exploration of new technologies to improve air quality related services. However, before using data from these sources, calibration procedures are needed to ensure that the quality of the data is at a good level. We describe our steps towards developing calibration models and how they benefit the applications identified as important in the talks with the municipality. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Critical technique errors are very often performed by patients in the use of Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) resulting in a reduction of the clinical efficiency of such medication. Those critical errors include: pure inhalation, non-arming of the device, no exhalation before or after inhalation, and non-holding of breath for 5\u201310 s between inhalation and exhalation. In this work, an audio-based classification method that assesses patient DPI user technique is presented by extracting the the non-silent audio segments and categorizing them into respiratory sounds. Twenty healthy and non-healthy volunteers used the same placebo inhaler (Bretaris Genuair Inhaler) in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The audio-based method achieved an F1-score of 89.87% in classifying sound events (Actuation, Inhale, Button Press, and Exhale). The significance of the algorithm lies not just on automatic classification but on a post-processing step of peak detection that resulted in an improvement of 5.58% on the F1-score, reaching 94.85%. This method can provide a clinically accurate assessment of the patient\u2019s inhaler use without the supervision of a doctor. View Full-Text",

Based on the system prototype and the use of the CyberGrasp haptic device, a number of custom applications have been developed. An efficient collision detection algorithm is also introduced, by extending the proximity query package (PQP) algorithm to handle five points of contact (a case studied with the use of CyberGrasp). Two test categories were identified and corresponding tests were developed for each category. The training scenarios include: object recognition \u2026",

In the past decade, semantic models such as ontologies have been proven to be effective for many knowledge-intensive applications, since they provide formal models of domain knowledge that can be exploited in different ways. For all these reasons, an innovative human resource optimisation (HRO) engine is introduced \u2026",

Particularly, this technique regards training some unsupervised machine learning model using high amount of historical process data from such equipment as input and stop data as reference. The goal is to correlate as strongly as possible the anomalies found by the model in the process data with upcoming faults, according to a forecasting horizon. In this way, the outlier detection model serves for fault forecasting. In this work the pre-processing and automatic feature selection phases, which are of significant importance, are also described. Such trained model would be useful for an industrial operator if executed in real time, based on online process data, since potential anomaly alerts raised by the model could enable predictive maintenance.

While, in the last few years, there has been an increased number of research approaches towards CNN-based 2D human pose estimation from RGB images, respective work on CNN-based 3D human pose estimation from depth/3D data has been rather limited, with current approaches failing to outperform earlier methods, partially due to the utilization of depth maps as simple 2D single-channel images, instead of an actual 3D world representation. In order to overcome this limitation, and taking into consideration recent advances in 3D detection tasks of similar nature, we propose a novel fully-convolutional, detection-based 3D-CNN architecture for 3D human pose estimation from 3D data. The architecture follows the sequential network architecture \u2026",

This method might fail in regions where the pattern is absent, due to the geometry of the scene and/or the reflectivity properties of the test material. However, leveraging the texture information provided by a separate color sensor might uncover details otherwise unseen by the infrared sensors. We propose a cost aggregation method that utilizes both an infrared and a color image of the scene, making smart aggregation choices depending on the underlying texture information provided by the two separate images. We use our cost aggregation method with the fully self-supervised real-time architecture presented in [14], having in mind the usage of low-cost \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a framework for energy-based human activity recognition in a household environment. We apply machine learning techniques to infer the state of household appliances from their energy consumption data and use rule- based scenarios that exploit these states to detect human activity. Our decision engine achieved a 99.1% accuracy for real-world data collected in the kitchens of two smart homes.",

On contrary to most state-of-the-art approaches, the query model can be not only an existing object from a database but also a model manually generated by the user using sketches. In the context of the proposed framework, three interfaces to the sketch-based 3D search application were tested and comparative results were extracted according to usability and efficiency criteria.",

The use of ECM along with the information carried in the DC DCT coefficients was shown to result to very fast and accurate search and retrieval techniques. Additionally, an indexing oriented rate-distortion technique for the optimal thresholding of AC coefficients was introduced and tested. This technique selects the AC coefficients of each block that are going to be coded in order to achieve better indexing results, while producing JPEG compliant files.",

The complexity of cloud environments is increasing with scale and heterogeneity posing a challenge for the efficient management of cloud applications and data centre resources. The increasing ubiquity of social media, mobile and cloud computing combined with the Internet of Things and emerging paradigms such as Edge and Fog Computing is exacerbating this complexity. Given the scale, complexity and commercial sensitivity of hyperscale computing environments, the opportunity for experimentation is limited and requires substantial investment of resources both in terms of time and effort. DES provides a low risk technique for providing decision support for complex hyperscale computing scenarios. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the development and extension of tools to support DES for cloud computing resulting in a wide range of tools which vary in terms of their utility and features. Through a review and analysis of available literature, this paper provides an overview and multi-level feature analysis of 33 DES tools for cloud computing environments. This review updates and extends existing reviews to include not only autonomous simulation platforms, but also on plugins and extensions for specific cloud computing use cases. This review identifies the emergence of CloudSim as a de facto base platform for simulation research and shows a lack of tool support for distributed execution (parallel execution on distributed memory systems).",

            "Abstract": "Despite the acknowledged importance of quantitative security assessment in secure software development, current literature still lacks an efficient model for measuring internal software security risk. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical security assessment model (SAM), able to assess the internal security level of software products based on low-level indicators, ie, security-relevant static analysis alerts and software metrics. The model, following the guidelines of ISO/IEC 25010, and based on a set of thresholds and weights, systematically aggregates these low-level indicators in order to produce a high-level security score that reflects the internal security level of the analyzed software. The proposed model is practical, since it is fully automated and operationalized in the form of a standalone tool and as part of a broader Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) platform.

Currently, there are many haptic toolkits available. However, existing haptic toolkits are too complex and do not directly support adding haptic feedback in web applications. Moreover, some of the existing toolkits have been developed by companies that sell haptic devices supporting, thus, only their devices. This paper presents the P4A Haptic Toolkit developed in the context of the Prosperity4All FP7 project that enables adding haptic feedback to web applications by also supporting a variety of the most common existing haptic devices. Through this toolkit, a 3D scene containing virtual objects with haptic feedback can be \u2026",

These aging effects depend on material composition, object usage and weathering conditions but also on physical and chemical substance parameters. Some types of changes in the materials underneath the visible layers can also be detected and subsequently simulated.

In each case, the efficiency of the linear predictors is enhanced nonlinearly. Directional postprocessing is used in the quincunx case, and adaptive-length postprocessing in the row-column case. Both methods are seen to perform well. The resulting nonlinear interpolation schemes achieve extremely efficient image decorrelation. We further investigate context modeling and adaptive arithmetic coding of wavelet coefficients in a lossless compression framework. Special attention is given to the modeling contexts and the adaptation of the arithmetic coder to the actual data.

A wide variety of scopes, context of use and core technologies have been addressed by the Virtual Museums developed up to day. For instance, they may serve the preservation, dissemination, research, exhibition of digitalized cultural heritage in an engaging way for a wide range of visitors around the world, with the intention to increase the interest for physical real-world museums and/or cultural heritage itself. Moreover, VMs may use virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and web technologies to represent a simple or more complex dynamic 3D environment where an administrator have the opportunity to manage the virtual exhibition by manipulating objects [2, 3, 4].The current contribution presents the Virtual Museum (VM) developed within the framework of the EC-funded project Scan4Reco (665091). The design of the VM was based on modern architectural trends and the principles for immersive and engaging experience, through the use of the state of the art technologies, serving thus, the scope of facilitating the access and communication of cultural heritage assets, in a way that would be difficult or impossible to be accomplished with real-world museums.",

However, the presence of defects and dimensional deviations that occur during the process hinder the broad exploitation of 3D printing. In order to enhance the capabilities of this emerging technology, online quality control methodologies and verifications of the manufacturing process are necessary to be developed. In the present article, a low cost in-situ vision-based monitoring technique applied in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology is introduced. An optical scanning system was integrated in a commercial 3D Printer in order to scan and validate the performance of the procedure. The proposed methodology monitors the FDM process and correlates the theoretical 3D model with the manufactured one. This technique can be utilized in various additive manufacturing technologies providing integrity and reliability of the process, high quality standards and reduced production costs.",

Fusing these conventional features with moment-based ones extracted from the same modalities resulted to significantly higher accuracy, at the level of 93%.

The lack of authentication mechanisms in BGP, render it vulnerable to prefix hijacking attacks, which raise serious security concerns regarding both service availability and data privacy. To address these issues, this study presents BGPGraph, a scheme for detecting and visualising Internet routing anomalies. In particular, BGPGraph introduces a novel BGP anomaly metric that quantifies the degree of anomaly on the BGP activity, and enables the analyst to obtain an overview of the BGP status. The analyst, is afterwards able to focus on significant time windows for further analysis, by using a hierarchical graph visualisation scheme. Furthermore, BGPGraph uses a novel method for the quantification of information visualisation that allows for the evaluation, and optimal \u2026",

Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are widely used to achieve these goals by optimally distributing content to cache servers at the edge, access and core networks. More recently, virtualization and cloud computing are being used to deploy and utilize virtual Content Delivery Networks (vCDNs) to reduce costs and increase elasticity while avoiding performance, quality, reliability and availability limitations that characterize traditional CDNs. In order to study the effectiveness of virtual cache placements and optimal distribution over a real-world large-scale vCDN infrastructure, we model and simulate BT's network using a novel parallel simulation framework.

Occupant behaviour is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in the prediction of building energy use by simulation programs. In the present paper, we propose a novel way of building occupancy and energy consumption estimation. The proposed approach is a rule-based multi-agent agent simulation system that is driven by Business Process Models, which are used to adapt the trained occupancy and energy models to current, refurbished and new building designs. The occupancy and energy consumption models utilized in the presented work are trained based on real data collected from an enterprise building, are correlated among each other and are inter-related with the business processes occurring in it. Occupancy and energy consumption simulation output can be extracted either for the current and refurnished building, or for new designs of similar usage. Experimental results show that the proposed system can provide building energy consumption estimation closer to the actual recorded compared with the simulation results from established reference building performance tools.",

It uses a two-layer convolutional neural network to extract local features, which are combined with 40 statistical features and are fed to a fully-connected layer. It improves the classification performance, while it takes up 5\u20138 times less storage space and outputs more than double the throughput of the current state-of-the-art user-independent implementation on the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) dataset. It achieves 94.18% classification accuracy on a 10-fold user-independent cross-validation of the WISDM dataset.

The complexity of computing at the edge makes it increasingly difficult for infrastructure providers to plan for and provision resources to meet this demand.

A novel cross-modal retrieval framework is presented, in which the results of several unimodal retrieval systems are fused into a single multimodal list by the introduction of a cross-modal distance. For the presentation of the retrieved results, a multimodal visualization framework is also proposed, which extends existing unimodal similarity-based visualization methods for multimodal data. The similarity measure between two multimodal objects is defined as the weighted sum of unimodal similarities, with the weights determined via an interactive user feedback scheme. Experimental results show that the cross-modal framework outperforms unimodal and other multimodal approaches while the visualization framework enhances existing visualization methods by efficiently exploiting multimodality and user feedback.",

At high level, metaheuristic search establishes resource constraints for each aCell and determines parameters for the task-level operation scheduling. At low level, the task-level scheduling algorithm produces feasible assignments and schedules within a single aCell by backtracking through feasible time slots using an adaptive score metric.

Information from residential indoor environmental conditions, occupants\u2019 feedback and European standards are utilized. This analysis aims to understand and determine the optimal environmental conditions in indoor spaces based on occupants\u2019 satisfaction. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed analysis and its results can be the basis for the optimal indoor environmental conditions determination. A comfortable indoor environment was found to be when the indoor temperature is from 21.5  o C to 23.4  o C and humidity is from 43.5% to 46%. The visual comfort was estimated as neutral from 93 to 124 lux.",

This paper presents several aspects of a building monitoring and control system that has been developed. The system is based on a multi-sensorial network which is able to capture sustainability-related metrics due to the use of heterogeneous sensors such as occupancy detection sensors, environmental sensors, power consumption sensors and actuators. The availability of occupancy information at room or zone level which is achieved via the occupancy sensors, offers the opportunity to extract valuable information about the way the building is utilized. Furthermore, as the occupancy patterns considerably affect the building\u2019s indoor environmental condition and the consumed energy, occupancy estimation turns into a useful tool for the facility manager to analyze and then improve the building\u2019s energy performance and enhance the indoor environmental quality by applying control actions through the actuators. The building information is visualized in the spatio-temporal domain to both the facility manager and the occupants via two different components. The system has been evaluated in real-life conditions at a building which is comprised of different types of spaces. Results showed that useful conclusions are drawn when occupancy information is combined with the other monitored parameters.",

            "Abstract": "Residential load forecasting is one of the most important tasks of the overall supply management process in electrical grids, since it enables smart grid services such as demand response (DR). Hence, several approaches for accurate residential load forecasting have been proposed in the relevant literature. However, most of the existing methods focus on the forecasting performance and neglect other aspects of the problem like training time and model size (ie memory usage). In this paper, we introduce a new model for both short-term and day-ahead residential load forecasting. The model synthesizes an heterogeneous feature set, which is constituted by both automatically-selected lagged values from the load time series and manually-extracted temporal features. Then, the tree-based algorithm light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) is fed with the constructed feature set and used as a regression model. Finally, a data-lightweight strategy is used for retraining the proposed model, which leads to both high forecasting accuracy and low training times. The proposed model has been extensively evaluated on a large real-world residential load dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves both higher forecasting performance and lower training times and model sizes compared to state-of-the-art solutions.",

While the majority of the existing building stock has poor energy performance, deep renovation efforts are stymied by a wide range of human, technological, organisational and external environment factors across the value chain. A key challenge is integrating appropriate human resources, materials, fabrication, information and automation systems and knowledge management in a proper manner to achieve the required outcomes and meet the relevant regulatory standards, while satisfying a wide range of stakeholders with differing, often conflicting, motivations. RINNO is a Horizon 2020 project that aims to deliver a set of processes that, when working together, provide a system, repository, marketplace and enabling workflow process for managing deep renovation projects from inception to implementation. This paper presents a roadmap for an open renovation platform for managing and delivering deep renovation projects for residential buildings based on seven design principles. We illustrate a preliminary stepwise framework for applying the platform across the full-lifecycle of a deep renovation project.

            "Abstract": "The customization level of vehicles is growing in order to deal with increasing user needs. Web browsers are becoming the focal point of vehicle customization, forming personalized market places where users can select and preview various setups. However the state of the art for the completion of the transaction is still very much characterized by a face-to-face sales situation. Direct sales over the internet, without sales person contacts, are still a small segment of the market, of only a few percent, for European manufacturers. This paper presents an Intelligent DIY e-commerce system for vehicle design, based on 3D Visualization and Ontologies that aims at enabling a suitable representation of products with the most realistic possible visualization outcome in order to help prospective customers in their decision. The platform, designed for the vehicle sector, includes all the practicable electronic commerce variants and its on-line product configuration process is controlled by an ontology that was created using the OWL Web Ontology Language.",

In this work, Fire Event Analytics, a Visual Analytics tool that can operate as part of a fire event information system, is presented. Fire Event Analytics utilizes data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles, effectively supporting wildland fire management. It is cloud-based and presents spatial and temporal cues to the end user, in order to form a comprehensive operations control module and enhance decision support. In that direction, fire growth prediction and simulation is supported, allowing hypothetical testing and comparison of multiple fire event scenarios, whereas a novel metric is introduced for assessing fire event criticality.",

Hardware accelerators have been used in cloud computing as well, though existing cloud simulation frameworks do not support modeling and simulation of such hardware. Models for the estimation of the power consumption of accelerators have been proposed by many researchers, but they require large number of inputs and computations, making them unsuitable for hyper scale simulations. In previous work, a generic model for the estimation of the power consumption of accelerators has been proposed, that can be combined with generic CPU power models suitable for integration in hyper scale simulation environments. This paper extends this work by providing models for the energy consumption of GPUs and CPU-GPU pairs, that are experimentally validated \u2026",

The recognition of the performed activity is based on Generalized Radon transforms that are applied on spatiotemporal motion templates. User authentication is performed exploiting the behavioural variations between different users, regardless of small variations in the interaction setting. The upper body limb anthropometric information is extracted for each user and an attributed body-related graph structure framework is employed for the detection of static biometric features of important discrimination power. Finally, a quality factor based on ergonomic criteria evaluates the recognition capacity of each activity. Experimental validation illustrates that the proposed approach for integrating static anthropometric features and activity-related \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is growing rapidly in a wide range of consumer applications, as they prove to be both autonomous and flexible in a variety of environments and tasks. However, this versatility and ease of use also brings a rapid evolution of threats by malicious actors that can use UAVs for criminal activities, converting them to passive or active threats. The need to protect critical infrastructures and important events from such threats has brought advances in counter UAV (c-UAV) applications. Nowadays, c-UAV applications offer systems that comprise a multi-sensory arsenal often including electro-optical, thermal, acoustic, radar and radio frequency sensors, whose information can be fused to increase the confidence of threat\u2019s identification. Nevertheless, real-time surveillance is a cumbersome process, but it is absolutely essential to detect promptly the occurrence of adverse events or conditions. To that end, many challenging tasks arise such as object detection, classification, multi-object tracking and multi-sensor information fusion. In recent years, researchers have utilized deep learning based methodologies to tackle these tasks for generic objects and made noteworthy progress, yet applying deep learning for UAV detection and classification is considered a novel concept. Therefore, the need to present a complete overview of deep learning technologies applied to c-UAV related tasks on multi-sensor data has emerged. The aim of this paper is to describe deep learning advances on c-UAV related tasks when applied to data originating from many different sensors as well as multi-sensor information fusion.

The low resolution of the facial region of interest is compensated via oversampling techniques and efficient trimming algorithms for the generation of an accurate 3D facial model. Two state of the art algorithms for geometric feature extraction are then utilized, i.e. the estimation of the Directional Indices between all the isogeodasic stripes of the same facial surface via the 3D WeightedWalkthroughs (3DWW) transformation and the estimation of the Spherical Face Representation (SFR). The biometric signature is then enhanced via user-specific cohort biometric templates for each feature, respectively. The experiments have been carried out on the demanding \"BIOTAFTOTITA\" dataset and the results are very promising even under difficult scenarios (e.g. looking away \u2026",

As cache placement is based on both the content type and geographic location of a user request, it has a significant impact on service delivery and network congestion. To study the effectiveness of cache placements and hierarchical network architectures composed of sites, a novel parallel simulation framework is proposed utilizing a discrete-time approach. Unlike other simulation approaches, the proposed simulation framework can update, in parallel, the state of sites and their resource utilization with respect to incoming requests in a significantly faster manner at hyperscale. It allows for simulations with multiple \u2026",

Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for anomaly detection in 3G/4G mobile networks based on Bayesian Robust Principal Component Analysis (BRPCA), which enables cognition in mobile networks through the ability to perceive threats and to act in order to mitigate their effects. BRPCA is used to model aggregate network data and subsequently identify abnormal network states. A major difference with previous work is that this method takes into account the spatio-temporal nature of the mobile network \u2026",

By means of the proposed categorization technique, automatic web service invocation is enabled in addition to semantic annotation of web service. Apart from presenting the theoretical details of the semantic categorization technique, this paper conducts preliminary assessment of its performance in terms of classification accuracy and compares it to one of the most known and successful web service classification tools.",

            "Abstract": "Imunoglobulins (Igs) are crucial for the defense against pathogens, but they are also important in many clinical and biotechnological applications. Their characteristics, and ultimately their function, depend on their three-dimensional (3D) structure; however, the procedures to experimentally determine it are extremely laborious and demanding. Hence, the ability to gain insight into the structure of Igs at large relies on the availability of tools and algorithms for producing accurate Ig structural models based on their primary sequence alone. These models can then be used to determine structural and eventually functional similarities between different Igs. An example of such a task is the clustering of Igs based on their structure to determine meaningful common features such as the possible existence of common molecular targets (antigens). Several approaches have been proposed in order to achieve an optimal solution to this task yet their results were hindered mainly due to the lack of efficient clustering methods based on the similarity of 3D structure descriptors. Here, we present a novel workflow for robust Ig 3D modeling and automated clustering. We validated our protocol in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the clonotypic Igs are critically implicated in the disease ontogeny and evolution. Indeed, immunogenetic studies on the clonotypic Igs have strongly implicated antigen selection in the pathogenesis of CLL, while also providing robust prognostic information. In the present study, we used the structure prediction tools PIGS and I-TASSER for creating the 3D models and the TM-align algorithm to superpose them. The innovation of the \u2026",

One of the principal applications of blockchain technology is peer-to-peer energy trading among stakeholders of smart grids, providing trusted transactions without the need of third parties. Also, e-auctions are rapidly growing as a mean of e-commerce that allows direct product bidding through the internet. One of the major issues of e-auctions is the reliance on a third-party to host the e-auction platform which not only induces extra cost and complexity of transactions, but also the third-party should be trusted by buyers and sellers, as it handles all the e-auction processes. In addition, trust may also be undermined by potential malicious sellers or buyers.

In this sense, the European Commission has focused attention on the security of communications in high-risk systems when receiving a cyber-attack such as automated vehicles. The project SerIoT comes up as an possible solution, providing a useful open and reference framework for real-time monitoring of the traffic exchanged through heterogeneous IoT platforms. This system is capable of recognize suspicious patterns, evaluate them and finally take mitigate actions. The paper presents a use case of the SerIoT project related to rerouting tests in vehicular communication. The goal is to ensure secure and reliable communication among Connected Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) components (vehicles, infrastructures, etc) using the SerIoT\u2019s system capabilities to detect and mitigate possible network attacks. Therefore, fleet management and smart intersection scenarios were chosen, where vehicles equipped with On Board Units (OBU) interact with each other and Road Side Units (RSU) to accomplish an optimal flow of traffic. These equipments use the SerIoT systems to deal with cyber-attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Tests have been validated in different scenarios under threats situations. It shows the great performance of the SerIoT system taking the corresponding actions to ensure a continuous and safety traffic flow.\u00a9 2021 The Author (s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

            "Abstract": "The surveillance of valuable infrastructure, such as photovoltaic parks, is considered of fundamental importance for their proper function and maintenance as well as the avoidance of criminal damage incidents. At the same time, the privacy of employees working in the same area should not be jeopardized and their personal data should always be protected. The use of thermal cameras presents a solution to both of the above issues by offering an unobtrusive surveillance approach with the ability to supervise industrial premises under a wide range of environmental and situational conditions. The current paper proposes an algorithm for the classification of moving objects that aims to increase the efficiency of surveillance methodologies by shifting the focus on high-risk classes, such as humans instead of animals. The proposed methodology utilizes an automated decision framework that determines when textural features are fit to be used, based on the discriminative power of the texture of the object. Many texture descriptors were tested, including Local Phase Quantisation and Histograms of Oriented Gradients, resulting in the use of a lately proposed combination of these descriptors. This new multi-class object classification approach introduces the use of confidence values and a voting system to achieve a more accurate selection of the appropriate class. The velocity was also used as a discriminative feature, especially to help distinguish between humans and motorcycles. Several algorithms have been used to validate the results of the experimental studies with special focus on the classification accuracy. The experimental results were \u2026",

Buildings are a major constituent of the urban ecosystem accounting for almost 40% of the overall energy demand in Europe1. Urban Sustainability heavily relies on building operational and space utilization characteristics as well as the behaviour of their occupants. Past and recent studies on energy efficiency in buildings indicated that appropriate design improvements, tailored with the support of building performance simulation software, could reduce energy use in both existing and in new building envelopes2. With enriched simulation results in hand, planners, designers and architects will be able to analyse the future performance of a building envelope with sufficient accuracy and granularity, taking into account both descriptive data on the building (material, components, equipments, space layout, etc) and information related to the dynamic behaviour of the building due to its usage and operation by humans. Focusing on the early design phases of a construction product, there is lately an increasing emphasis on delivering simulation tools and methods that improve the prediction of the building energy use by analyzing also the performance in connection with the space utilization of the building by its occupants3.

            "Abstract": "Accurately forecasting power generation in photovoltaic (PV) installations is a challenging task, due to the volatile and highly intermittent nature of solar-based renewable energy sources. In recent years, several PV power generation forecasting models have been proposed in the relevant literature. However, there is no consensus regarding which models perform better in which cases. Moreover, literature lacks of works presenting detailed experimental evaluations of different types of models on the same data and forecasting conditions. This paper attempts to fill in this gap by presenting a comprehensive benchmarking framework for several analytical, data-based and hybrid models for multi-step short-term PV power generation forecasting. All models were evaluated on the same real PV power generation data, gathered from the realisation of a small scale pilot site in Thessaloniki, Greece. The models predicted PV power generation on multiple horizons, namely for 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min and 180 min ahead of time. Based on the analysis of the experimental results we identify the cases, in which specific models (or types of models) perform better compared to others, and explain the rationale behind those model performances.

After proper positioning and alignment of the 3D models, a watermark is embedded in the vertices of the model using a robust technique for modifying imperceptibly the location of a subset of the 3D model vertices. The watermark can be used as a link to an identifier for the 3D model and the entire system can be used for data hiding applications. One application is the use of watermark as a link to 3D model descriptors for content-based search and retrieval. Experimental results show the ability of the proposed method to the aforementioned attacks. The proposed method is also robust against vertex reordering attack.",

Moreover, the conducted evaluation procedure reveals the degree of conformance of the benchmarked methodologies to a set of standardized criteria.

Secondly, by exploiting dataaugmentation techniques and using the whole segment (as opposed to splitting into sub-sequences) as an input, the accuracy of our CNN system was boosted to 95.9%. However, due to the small number of kernels used for the CNN and a failure of capturing the global information of the audio signals, it achieved an accuracy of 49.5% on the evaluation dataset. Our two approaches outperformed the DCASE baseline method, which uses log-mel band energies for feature extraction and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to achieve an average accuracy over 4-folds of 74.8%.",

In carpooling, the same amount of people move with fewer vehicles leading to reduced traffic congestion and consequently to less CO2 emissions, fuel consumption and drivers frustration. However, there has always been scepticism around carpooling due to the inherent mistrust between drivers and passengers. In recent years, some reputation systems have been proposed to reduce the impact of mistrust on carpooling applications. Among them, the work of Salamanis et al.(Salamanis, 2018), in which a reputation assessment mechanism based on clustering users travel preferences, was introduced. In this paper, we provide an extended version of the previous mechanism and we thoroughly evaluate its robustness in relation with different types of malicious attacks and clustering algorithms. In addition, we compare our mechanism with a benchmarking reputation system that utilizes the simple arithmetic mean to calculate reputation values based on users ratings. The evaluation results indicate that the extended reputation assessment mechanism exhibits more robust behavior compared to the benchmarking system in all types of attacks when using the hierarchical clustering algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "Although the etiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of adult leukemia, is still unclear, strong evidence implicates antigen involvement in disease ontogeny and evolution. Primary and 3D structure analysis has been utilised in order to discover indications of antigenic pressure. The latter has been mostly based on the 3D models of the clonotypic B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) amino acid sequences. Therefore, their accuracy is directly dependent on the quality of the model construction algorithms and the specific methods used to compare the ensuing models. Thus far, reliable and robust methods that can group the IG 3D models based on their structural characteristics are missing. Here we propose a novel method for clustering a set of proteins based on their 3D structure focusing on 3D structures of BcR IG from a large series of patients with CLL. The method combines techniques from the areas of bioinformatics, 3D object recognition and machine learning. The clustering procedure is based on the extraction of 3D descriptors, encoding various properties of the local and global geometrical structure of the proteins. The descriptors are extracted from aligned pairs of proteins. A combination of individual 3D descriptors is also used as an additional method. The comparison of the automatically generated clusters to manual annotation by experts shows an increased accuracy when using the 3D descriptors compared to plain bioinformatics-based comparison. The accuracy is increased even more when using the combination of 3D descriptors. The experimental results verify that the use of 3D descriptors \u2026",

An ICT (Information and Communication Technology) tool that may be used to manage and optimize the flexibility offered by energy storage and conversion systems is described in this paper with specific reference to the Decision Support System (DSS) developed within the H2020 PLANET (PLAnning and operational tools for optimizing energy flows and synergies between energy NETworks) project. The paper focuses on how the PLANET DSS tool evaluates, manages, and dispatches the flexibility of Power to Gas/Heat (P2X) technologies. Moreover, the tool has been used to analyze a realistic case in order to show how the PLANET DSS tool could be used to evaluate the energy and economic benefits of taking advantage of the flexibility of P2X technologies.",

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the instant game of chance ticket or an on-line game token will comprise a gaming component and an investment component. In one scenario, the gaming component is the traditional game feature offered by an instant game of chance ticket or on-line game. The investment component of a ticket is the investment value of a ticket or on-line game as a function of the face value paid for the ticket. This investment value is a sort of micro-financing investment made by the purchaser in return for which the purchaser is given a share interest in an investment pool of companies very similar to traditional share ownership in a company, or the purchase of a corporate bond exercisable at a future date in exchange \u2026",

Considering the European context, in which health data must be exchanged between different European Union (EU) Member States, each having a different national regulatory framework as well as different national healthcare structures, the challenge appears even greater. Europe has tried to address this challenge via the epSOS (\u201cSmart Open Services for European Patients\u201d) project in 2008, a European large-scale pilot on cross-border sharing of specific health data and services. The adoption of the framework is an ongoing activity, with most Member States planning its implementation by 2020. Yet, this framework is quite generic and leaves a wide space to each EU Member State regarding the definition of roles, processes, workflows and especially the specific integration with the National Infrastructures \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In 2020, residential sector loads reached 25% of the overall electrical consumption in Europe and it is foreseen to stabilise at 29% by 2050. However, this relatively small increase demands, among others, changes in the energy consuming behaviour of households. To achieve this, Demand Response (DR) has been identified as a promising tool for unlocking the hidden flexibility potential of residential consumption. In this work, a holistic incentive-based DR framework aiming towards load shifting is proposed for residential applications. The proposed framework is characterised by several innovative features, mainly the formulation of the optimisation problem, which models user satisfaction and the economic operation of a distributed household portfolio, the customised load forecasting algorithm, which employs an adjusted Gradient Boosting Tree methodology with enhanced feature extraction and, finally, a disaggregation tool, which considers electrical features and time of use information. The DR framework is first validated through simulation to assess the business potential and is then deployed experimentally in real houses in Northern Greece. Results demonstrate that a mean 1.48% relative profit can be achieved via only load shifting of a maximum of three residential appliances, while the experimental application proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in successfully managing the load curves of real houses with several residents. Correlations between market prices and the success of incentive-based load shifting DR programs show how wholesale pricing should be adjusted to ensure the viability of such DR schemes.",

Due to the non-negative constraints explicitly enforced, the extracted eigenvectors turn to be sparse without employing any sparsity controlling parameter. Accordingly, only one parameter has to be tuned, i.e., the learning rate. Also, the complexity of the method under study is approximately linear under plausible assumptions.

Content objects are rich media presentations, enclosing different types of media, along with real-world information and user-related information. These highly complex presentations require a suitable description scheme in order to be searched and retrieved by end users. Therefore, a novel rich unified content description is analysed, which provides a uniform descriptor for all types of content objects irrespective of the underlying media and accompanying information.",

            "Abstract": "The recent advances in automated control and decision making has resulted in well-organized power systems that are less susceptible to blackouts. Nevertheless, the presence of restoration processes is still essential and should follow the trend of automated decision making and control. To this end, this paper presents a Multi Agent System (MAS) focused to provide two restoration processes, namely Voltage & Frequency restoration and Black Start optimal sequence re-connection of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and loads. MAS is capable of operating on either semi-centralised or distributed control modes making the system resilient against Single Point of Failure (SPOF). The system is evaluated in a simulated low-voltage Microgrid developed in MATLAB/Simulink and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed processes. Finally, empirical synthetic topologies are utilized to demonstrate \u2026",

Using advanced perception and simulation technologies, the interface provides the proper tools for a non-expert user to teach a robot a new assembly task in a short amount of time. An RGBD camera is used to allow the user to demonstrate the task and the system extracts the needed information for the assembly to be simulated and performed by the robot, while the user guides the process. The HRI interface is integrated with the ROS framework and is built as a web application allowing operation through portable devices, such as a tablet PC. The interface is evaluated with user experience rating from test subjects that are requested to teach a folding assembly task to the robot.",

Software Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies network management tasks by separating the control plane. However, the increased network traffic results in energy and Quality of Service (QoS) efficiency issues, whereas IoT devices are susceptible to failures and attacks that have serious security consequences. In this regard, providing a guarantee that SDN routing satisfies energy, QoS and security related policies is crucial for the network management. In this paper, we propose a policy-based framework aiming to verify that SDN routing decisions are optimal regarding energy, QoS and security properties. The proposed framework will enable the IoT network operator to adjust the policy constraints according to the demands of each use case (eg, aiming at more secure or faster network).

            "Abstract": "With the proliferation of high resolution 3D scanners, the quality of recorded 3D models has greatly improved. Nonetheless, while geometric fidelity is important, color information is still required to achieve photo-realistic 3D models. In this regard, texture reconstruction techniques combine color images from several views in order to optimally color the mesh of a 3D model. Nonetheless, a major challenge that is often overlooked by existing approaches is the technical limitations of color acquisition devices that lead to erroneously colored 3D models. In this paper, a novel technique is presented that formulates texture reconstruction as an optimization problem incorporating a color correction term in its objective function. The underlying rationale is to exploit external to the 3D scanner color measurements that can be available from more reliable sensors such as a UV- VIS spectrometer. Such measurements are often \u2026",

In order to help users cope with the ever-growing video volume, recommendation systems have emerged that can provide personalized suggestions to users based on their past preferences and relevant online metrics. However, such approaches require user profiling, which raises privacy issues while often providing delayed suggestions as various metrics have to be firstly collected such as ratings and number of views. In this paper, we propose a system specifically targeting video content generated in a conference event, where a series of talks and presentations are held and a separate video for each is recorded. Through audience analysis, our system is able to predict the online views of each video and thus recommend the most popular videos to users. This way, online users don\u2019t have to search through all the videos \u2026",

In this specific study we introduce a holistic framework for determining a repository of key performance indicators (KPIs) that are able to evaluate both business-as-usual and novel technologies and services related to smart city solutions. The framework includes six steps:(a) Clustering of the technology/service solutions into groups called Transition Tracks;(b) definition of the main groups of stakeholders;(c) definition of KPIs dimensions (or domains);(d) definition of KPIs repository per dimension;(e) definition of the scope of evaluation per KPI; and (f) threshold definition per KPI. The implementation of the proposed framework led to the development of a repository of 75 KPIs categorized in six dimensions (technical, environmental, economic, social, ICT and legal KPIs) with the corresponding levels of assessment and stakeholders\u2019 group of interest. The proposed repository can serve as a great basis for similar projects to monitor and evaluate the performance of their solutions. Tips and guidance based on the actual implementation and lessons learned from a smart city project are provided. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "The present paper proposes a novel method for 3D-model watermarking for indexing. The proposed approach is based on the use of a generalized Radon transformation. More specifically, the cylindrical integration transform (CIT) is initially applied to the 3D models in order to produce descriptor vectors. At the same time a watermarking technique, based on CIT is used in order to embed a specific model identifier in the nodes of the 3D model. This identifier links the model to its descriptor vector, which is extracted only once and stored in a database. Every time this model is employed as a query model, watermark detection is used so as to retrieve the corresponding identifier and further the descriptor vector, which can be further used in a matching algorithm. The proposed techniques are evaluated experimentally in terms of both watermarking efficiency and content-based retrieval performance.",

Predicting the future value of TD could facilitate decision-making tasks regarding software maintenance and assist developers and project managers in taking proactive actions regarding TD repayment. However, no notable contributions exist in the field of TD forecasting, indicating that it is a scarcely investigated field. This study constitutes an initial attempt towards this direction. To this end, in the present study, we empirically evaluate the ability of time series analysis to model and predict TD evolution. To create our dataset, we obtain weekly snapshots of five open source software projects over three years and compute their TD values. We find that the autoregressive integrated moving average model ARIMA (0, 1, 1) can provide accurate predictions over a fairly long time period for all sampled projects. The model can be used to facilitate planning for software evolution budget and time allocation. The approach presented in this paper provides a basis for predictive TD analysis, suitable for projects with a relatively long history.",

The proposed visual queries enable the analyst to select a significant subset of the initial dataset for further analysis, based on the values of multiple features. This procedure allows for the efficient visual fusion of the proposed features and the accurate identification of prefix hijacks.

            "Abstract": "Modern critical operations and defence applications require highly demanding information and communication systems, making ad hoc networks, which are mainly used nowadays in tactical zones, to be difficult to manage. The evolution of the Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology has brought new perspectives to security and defence applications, making them more reliable, more stable, more secure and more portable. This research paper proposes an SDN topology for secure communications in a tactical environment, overcoming several challenges that a conventional network faces. Moreover, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodology, exclusively used in SDN environments is presented, providing Quality of Service (QoS) features to the network, based on which rerouting paths can be calculated. Finally, our routing methodology is illustrated using representative evaluation scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "This work presents a framework for the synthesis of stereoscopic video using as input only a monoscopic image sequence. Initially, bi-directional 2D motion estimation is performed, which is followed by an efficient method for the reliable tracking of object contours. Rigid 3D motion and structure is recovered utilizing extended Kalman filtering. Finally, occlusions are dealt with a novel Bayesian framework, which exploits future information to correctly reconstruct occluded areas. Experimental evaluation shows that the layered object scene representation, combined with the proposed methods for object tracking throughout the sequence and occlusion handling, yields very accurate results.",

            "Abstract": "A traffic management system for narrow roads that utilizes RGB cameras is proposed in this paper. The system is able to detect and recognize any large vehicles trying to cross narrow roads and control the traffic accordingly, for example prevent two large vehicles from entering the road from different directions simultaneously. The system is based on adaptive methodologies so that it can adjust to changing conditions of lighting. Moreover, a calibration technique combined with a fine tuning procedure overcome the limitations of a predefined camera setting. The goal of this paper is a system that optimizes the flow at the roads under monitoring with the use of traffic lights or VMS (variable-message signs). To our knowledge, there are no similar systems aiming at real time traffic management of narrow roads.",

The system uses both centralised and decentralised strategies to optimize the microgrid energy control while addressing the challenges introduced by current technologies and applied systems in real microgrid infrastructures. The well-known 3-level control (tertiary, secondary, primary) is employed with an enhanced hierarchical design using intelligent agent-based components in order to improve efficiency, diversity, modularity, and scalability. The main contribution of this paper is dual. During normal operation, the microgrid central controller (MGCC) is designed to undertake the management of the microgrid, while providing the local agents with the appropriate constraints for optimal power flow. During MGCC fault, a peer-to-peer communication is enabled between neighbouring agents in order to make their optimal decision locally. The initial \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a service-oriented application whose purpose is to assist various activities of mobility impaired people as they move from one location to another. Such activities include trip planning, route guidance, e-working, e-learning, search for points of interest and social events among others. A number of registered web services provide all the required content and information that are displayed on the end-user device. Existing services are marked up by a number of domain ontologies about the information needs of mobility impaired users, in order to enable ontology-based search and retrieval of services. A service alignment tool has been developed to facilitate the markup process on behalf of service providers. After describing the architecture of the overall application and the involved mechanisms, we demonstrate a number of use cases that are enabled by the presented technologies.",

            "Abstract": "Mobile interconnectivity and telemedicine are important issues for achieving effectiveness in health care, since medical information can be transmitted faster and physicians can make diagnoses and treatment decisions faster. In this context, the OTELO project (OTELO, 2001) aims to develop a fully integrated end-to-end mobile tele-echography system using an ultra light, remote-controlled robot, for population groups that are not served locally by medical experts. An expert located in the expert center will do the echographic diagnosis. There will be only a \u201cnon-sonographer\u201d person in the isolated site and the wireless transmission system will be the only link between the two sites. At the master station site, the clinical expert's role is to control and tele-operate the distant robot by holding a fictive probe.",

            "Abstract": "Blockchain technology enables the trustless sharing of distributed ledgers among peers. Despite having valuable properties like decentralisation, and immutability of transactions, it incurs a high performance overhead as compared with traditional databases thus discouraging its further adoption. Even the usage of different transaction processors within the same Blockchain platform, namely Hyperledger Sawtooth, may result in different performance, for the same use case and the same transaction type. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the performance of two different transaction processors deployed in the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. We evaluated experimentally the methodology and present the results of the experimental evaluation which may be useful to blockchain practitioners for future solution designs.",

            "Abstract": "Sustainable energy is hands down one of the biggest challenges of our times. As the EU sets its focus to reach its 2030 and 2050 goals, the importance of energy efficiency for energy consumers/prosumers becomes prevalent. Over the years, a lot of different approaches have been followed to engage end-users and affect energyrelated occupant behaviour towards improving energy efficiency results and long term behaviour changes. This work presents the SIT4Energy user-centered approach for tertiary buildings that delivers an end-toend solution that takes into consideration a set of tools and models for successfully engaging and affecting the end-user\u2019s energy-related behaviour. Starting from appropriate user profiling models for energyrelated behaviour models and an explainable recommendation engine, to on the fly human activity tracking and micro-moments detection on mobile devices, a set of recommendations are delivered to the endusers through a mobile device, presenting valuable information with usertailored context and on the optimal timing. The overall solution is clearly documented, whereas real-life results are presented from the deployment in offices in a university building. From the evaluation performed it is clearly depicted that a positive impact has been achieved both in terms of energy efficiency as well as energy-related behaviour.",

This fact is highly related to the physical and cognitive decline of aged people, influencing the way they apprehend their environment and, thus, their daily activities. Towards this direction, the \u201cRobotic Assistant for MCI patients at home\u201d (RAMCIP) project, initiated by the European Union, intends to build a service robot that will operate in domestic environments with the aim to proactively and discreetly support older persons and MCI patients. The key component to achieve this goal is the design of a robot endowed with high-level cognitive functions, driven by advanced human and environment perception mechanisms, that will enable the artificial agent to autonomously decide when and how to assist.
