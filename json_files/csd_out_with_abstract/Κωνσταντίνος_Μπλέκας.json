This allows to augment the model with advantageous sparse priors provided by the RVM's regression framework.

The contribution of this work is the introduction of a smoothing prior over component regression coefficients through a Bayesian framework. This is done by using an appropriate Student-t distribution. The advantages of the sparsity-favouring prior is to make model more robust, less independent on order p of polynomials and improve the clustering procedure. The whole framework is converted into a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where the known EM algorithm can be applied offering update equations for the model parameters in closed forms. The efficiency of the proposed sparse mixture model is experimentally shown by applying it on various real benchmarks and by comparing it with the typical regression mixture and the K-means algorithm. The results are very promising.",

            "Abstract": "In this article, we report on the efficiency and effectiveness of multiagent reinforcement learning methods (MARL) for the computation of flight delays to resolve congestion problems in the Air Traffic Management (ATM) domain. Specifically, we aim to resolve cases where demand of airspace use exceeds capacity (demand-capacity problems), via imposing ground delays to flights at the pre-tactical stage of operations (i.e. few days to few hours before operation). Casting this into the multiagent domain, agents, representing flights, need to decide on own delays w.r.t. own preferences, having no information about others' payoffs, preferences and constraints, while they plan to execute their trajectories jointly with others, adhering to operational constraints. Specifically, we formalize the problem as a multiagent Markov Decision Process (MA-MDP) and we show that it can be considered as a Markov game in which interacting agents need to reach an equilibrium: What makes the problem more interesting is the dynamic setting in which agents operate, which is also due to the unforeseen, emergent effects of their decisions in the whole system. We propose collaborative multiagent reinforcement learning methods to resolve demand-capacity imbalances: Extensive experimental study on real-world cases, shows the potential of the proposed approaches in resolving problems, while advanced visualizations provide detailed views towards understanding the quality of solutions provided.",

By taking into account spatial information, adjacent pixels are more probable to belong to the same cluster (which is intuitively desirable). Also, all of the model parameters are estimated in closed form from the data.

At each time step, the procedure either adds a new cluster, or adjusts the winning cluster\u2019s parameters.

We evaluate our approach in simulation, taking under consideration the dynamics of the platform, the dynamics and limitations of the actuators, under the presence of wind, and sea current disturbances.

To address this issue, we propose a novel measure to assess the local label imbalance of multi-label datasets, as well as two multi-label sampling approaches, namely Multi-Label Synthetic Oversampling based on Local label imbalance (MLSOL) and Multi-Label Undersampling based on Local label imbalance (MLUL).

            "Abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a novel technique for studying the human brain and obtaining maps of neuronal activity. An important goal in fMRI studies is to decompose the observed series of brain images in order either to detect activation when a stimulus is presented to the subject, or to identify and characterize underlying brain functional networks when the subject is at rest. In this chapter, a model class is presented for addressing this issue that consists of finite mixture of generalized linear regression models. The main building block of the method is the general linear model which constitutes a standard statistical framework for investigating relationships between variables of fMRI data. We extend this into a finite mixture framework that exploits enhanced modeling capabilities by incorporating some innovative sparse and spatial properties. In addition, a weighted multi-kernel \u2026",

Methods:  The approach sequentially adds a new motif component to a mixture model by performing a combined scheme of global and local search for appropriately initializing the component parameters. A hierarchical clustering scheme is also applied initially which leads to the identification of candidate motif models and speeds up the global searching procedure.  Results:  The performance of the proposed algorithm has been studied in both artificial and real biological datasets.

The main contribution of our method is that the trajectories are automatically extracted from the video sequence and they are provided directly to a model-based clustering approach. In most other methodologies, the latter constitutes a difficult part since the resulting feature trajectories have a short duration, as the key points disappear and reappear due to occlusion, illumination, viewpoint changes and noise. We present here a sparse, translation invariant regression mixture model for clustering trajectories of variable length. The overall scheme is converted into a Maximum A Posteriori approach, where the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for estimating the model parameters.

A simple two\u2010body potential is used to model the interaction under the influence of which the points move according to Newton's second law. This procedure produces a transformed data set with reduced cluster overlap, which favors the spectral clustering approach. This is so, because the affinity matrix can be enriched with information derived from the underlying interaction model. Special care is also given to estimate the Gaussian kernel parameter, since its role is important for the clustering procedure.

            "Abstract": "Brain tumors are one of the leading causes of death in adults with cancer; however, molecular classification of these tumors with in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is limited because of the small number of metabolites detected. In vitro MRS provides highly informative biomarker profiles at higher fields, but also consumes the sample so that it is unavailable for subsequent analysis. In contrast, ex vivo high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) MRS conserves the sample but requires large samples and can pose technical challenges for producing accurate data, depending on the sample testing temperature. We developed a novel approach that combines a two-dimensional (2D), solid-state, HRMAS proton (1H) NMR method, TOBSY (total through-bond spectroscopy), which maximizes the advantages of HRMAS and a robust classification strategy.

A significant problem, when analyzing fMRI time series, is the finding of functional brain networks when the brain is at rest, i.e. no external stimulus is applied to the subject. In this work, we present a probabilistic method to estimate the Resting State Networks (RSNs) using a model-based approach. More specifically, RSNs are assumed to be the result of a clustering procedure. In order to perform the clustering, a mixture of regression models are used. Furthermore, special care has been given in order to incorporate important functionalities, such as spatial and embedded sparsity enforcing properties, through the use of informative priors over the model parameters. Another interesting feature of the proposed scheme is the flexibility to handle all the brain time series at once, allowing more robust solutions. We provide comparative experimental results \u2026",

The method adds sequentially at each step a new multinomial component to a mixture model based on a combined scheme of global and local search in order to deal with the initialization problem of the EM algorithm. In the global search phase several initial values are examined for the parameters of the multinomial component. These values are selected from an appropriately defined set of initialization candidates. Two methods are proposed here to specify the elements of this set based on the agglomerative and the kd-tree clustering algorithms. We investigate the performance of the incremental learning technique on a synthetic and a real dataset and also provide comparative results with the \u2026",

A relatively new problem to the analysis of fMRI data is the identification of brain networks when the brain is at rest i.e. no external stimulus is applied to the subject. In this work a method to find the Resting State Networks (RSNs), using fMRI time series, is proposed. To achieve that our method uses the Regression Mixtures Models (RMMs). RMMs are mixture models specifically design to cluster time series. Furthermore, our method takes into account the spatial correlations of fMRI data by using a new functional for the responsibilities of the mixture. Experimental results have showed the usefullness of the proposed approach compared to other methods of the field such as the k-means algorithm.",

These features are fed to a neural network classifier based on geometrical fuzzy sets. Starting from the construction of the Voronoi diagram of the training patterns, an aggregation of Voronoi regions is performed, leading to the identification of larger regions belonging exclusively to one of the pattern classes.

A Bayesian ensemble regression framework is presented by considering that every combination of objects' material and bird type has its own regression model.

The main contribution of our method is that the trajectories are automatically extracted from the image sequence and they are provided directly to a model-based clustering approach. In most other methodologies, the latter constitutes a difficult part since the resulting feature trajectories have a short duration, as the key points disappear and reappear due to occlusion, illumination, viewpoint changes and noise. We present here a sparse, translation invariant regression mixture model for clustering trajectories of variable length. The overall scheme is converted into a maximum a posteriori approach, where the Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for estimating the model parameters.

Agents, representing flights, have limited information about others' payoffs and preferences, and need to coordinate to achieve their tasks while adhering to operational constraints. We formalize the problem as a multiagent Markov decision process (MDP) towards deciding flight delays to resolve demand and capacity balance (DCB) problems in ATM. To this end, we present multiagent reinforcement learning methods that allow agents to interact and form own policies in coordination with others.
