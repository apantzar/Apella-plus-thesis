In order to achieve misconception diagnosis, the authors of this paper have incorporated machine learning techniques in the aforementioned Facebook application. The confusion of Facebook users between multiple language learning is extensively examined. Misconception handling within the application renders the users capable of being aware of their misconceptions and prevents them from re-conducting them. Furthermore, the collaboration between users in language confusion conditions is ameliorated by the user clustering through the Facebook platform.",

            "Abstract": "Sentiment Analysis has become a powerful tool that supports the field of e-Iearning variously. Learners can unintentionally provide priceless information to the instructors concerning their emotional state. Educational software can then use this information to adapt the learning process to the emotional needs of learners. Similarly, instructors can then use this information in order render the learning experience more attractive. For instance, when sentiment analysis detects an emotional state of a student who has no interest in learning a specific subject, it can then motivate him/her not to quit learning. This paper presents a novel multicriteria framework for assessing sentiment analysis both in social and digital learning environments. Using this framework, a comparative analysis of sentiment analysis software is conducted. Its results demonstrate that there is scope for improvement in the field of sentiment analysis is \u2026",

ICALM takes into consideration each time the needs and abilities of each individual learner and adapts the learning material that is addressed to the learner at three levels. These three levels are: 1) knowledge level, 2) content, 3) display mode. The presented intelligent mechanism uses artificial neural networks, a method of multi-criteria decision analysis and machine learning techniques. The presented mechanism has been incorporated in two adaptive e-learning systems and was fully evaluated through questionnaire and t-test. The evaluation results are very encouraging showing that ICALM provides great assistance to learners in a computer-aided instruction environment.",

User model servers are very important because they allow reusability of user modeling reasoning mechanisms which are typically very complex and difficult to construct from scratch. In this paper we show how the potential of interoperability, reusability and component sharing offered by the technology of Web Services have been exploited in the design of a user model server that performs decision making. The reasoning of the user modeling is based on a multi-criteria decision making theory and has been implemented as a Web Service to provide intelligent assistance to users over the Web. Reusability has been shown through the successful application of the user model server into two different applications: an e-mail and a file manager application.",

In order to achieve that, I-Mailer constantly reasons about every user action in terms of the user's goals and plans. In case the user is involved in a problematic situation, it transforms the user's problematic action and generates alternative actions that are better than the problematic one in the context of the user's hypothesized intentions. In order to select the best alternative action to present to the user it uses the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is used in I-Mailer in order to find which alternative action is closest to an ideal alternative and propose it to the user.",

The need for time and place independence is even greater in some cases, such as for medical instructors who are usually doctors that have to treat patients on top of their tutoring duties. However, this independence from real teachers and classrooms may influence negatively the students who may feel deprived of the benefits of human\u2013human interaction. In this paper we describe a novel approach for incorporating affective characteristics into e-learning through an authoring tool. The authoring tool incorporates and adapts principles of a cognitive theory for modeling possible emotional states that a tutoring agent may use for educational purposes.

The system is called Web F-SMILE and is meant to help novice users learn how to manipulate their file store. The system has assigned an agent, called learner modelling (LM) agent, to constantly observe the user and collect information about him/her. This information is used by other agents in order to provide individualised help and tutoring. The LM Agent interacts with a learner modelling server through Web services. In this way, each learner model is available to any client application that requests it. The main advantage of this approach is that the learner model is not reinitialised every time the user changes the PC s/he uses. Moreover, Web services allow information to pass through most security systems and thus the reliability of the learner model information is ensured.",

Adopting pedagogical theories in educational systems is essential for developing integrated solutions that follow teaching strategies for effective learning and suit to students' needs. To this direction, this paper presents a new approach of applying behaviorist theory in a tutoring system for learning programming languages. Specifically, the presented e-learning system uses Skinner's conditioning as a method of instruction occurring through rewards and punishments for behavior. Through Skinnerian conditioning, students make an association between a particular behavior and a consequence. As a behaviorist theory, great importance is placed on how different patterns of reinforcement have different effects on the speed of learning and extinction.

In order to emphasize the educational usage of Facebook, we implemented an educational application, which is addressed to Greek users who want to learn the Conditionals grammatical structure in Filipino and vice versa. Given that educational applications are targeted to a heterogeneous group of people, user adaptation and individualization are promoted. Hence, we incorporated a student modeling component, which retrieves data from the user\u2019s Facebook profile and from a preliminary test to create a personalized learning profile. Furthermore, the system provides advice to each user, adapted to his/her knowledge level. To illustrate the modeling component, we presented a prototype Facebook application.

The trainees can design UML diagrams given by the trainer or run certain tests/exercises for specific problems that are given. They can collaborate with each other. The system offers them adaptive help and advice regarding the most effective and productive organization of the trainees in groups. This is done so that the users' collaboration among them can be more efficient. The adaptivity is achieved through user modelling based on stereotypes. The stereotypes are related to three aspects of the performance of the trainee: the Level of Expertise, the Performance Types and the Personality.",

An educational game can motivate a learner to participate in an educational process and increases her/his interest in the teaching knowledge domain.

The benefits of such technologies are widely accepted, so more and more educational applications are being developed. However, educational software aims to be used by students for learning. Therefore educational applications have to be as attractive as possible to increase the engagement of students. To serve this purpose many researchers employ several aspects of multimedia technology to improve the aesthetics and the appeal of educational software. One very attractive and popular application area, that involves and demands advanced multimedia technologies and could be used for educational purposes, is computer games.In this paper a virtual reality game for educational purposes is described. This tutoring system incorporates a virtual reality user interface similar to that of common commercial games. The game is enriched with student modeling mechanisms that ensure the individualisation of the interaction. In order to create the virtual environment of the game, Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) was used. Implementation issues of the virtual reality environment, and associated matters are being discussed.",

Our aim is to improve the quality of ISPSs for the improvement of procurement operations. The government and/or municipal offices request comments on an ISPS from the public before they open the ISPS to companies. The public comments are referred to in an attempt to further improve the quality of the ISPS. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the ISPS-Q Model, we obtained the public comments and their target ISPS for analyzation. As a result, we could clarify that most of the public comments were written with ambiguous words and/or incomplete statements. Furthermore, we could no regard these ambiguous and/or incomplete comments as a means to improve the quality of the ISPS. In this regard, the ISPS-Q Model is essential to the improvement of the quality of ISPSs. The ISPS-Q Model was developed by adding fair and deleting modifiable to IEEE Std. 830-1998, since fair is a property that the government requires of every ISPS, and that the ISPSs would never be changed after their procurement. We applied the model to a real ISPS and evaluated the quality of the ISPS. We found 19 problematic statements in the ISPS. Multiple companies submitted 109 comments regarding the same ISPS. In this paper, we discuss the differences between our comments and the public comments made by the companies. After that, we define new quality characteristics and reconstruct the ISPS-Q Model. We will close this paper by showing the revised ISPS-Q Model.",

Recent advancements and new trends in computers, such as Web-based technology, mobile software, integrated interactive environments have rendered computers accessible and indispensable to many users. However, at the same time new challenges have been introduced to the already complex task of knowledge-engineering with regard to Intelligent Interactive Software (IIS). IISs have to be personalized to address individual needs of users, they have to ensure interoperability, succeed in achieving reusability, possibly extend to further modalities that include vision and speech, provide emotional intelligence but most of all they have to retain usability and utility to justify for the complexity of their development. Given the fact that there are many underlying theories that can be applied in \u2026",

Whenever a student types a solution for an exercise, the system\u2019s reasoning mechanism examines the correctness of the student\u2019s answer. If the student\u2019s answer is erroneous, the system records it and attempts to diagnose the nature of the error. The system holds a student model, namely it keeps a profile of every student, and provides individualized help concerning performance and error diagnosis for three languages.

The results from this study confirm the hypothesis that a pedagogical agent incorporated in an ITS can enhance students' learning experience. On the other hand, the hypothesis that the presence of the agent improves short\u2010term learning effects was rejected.",

Through them, people can interact with others, share data or ideas, create communities and collaborate effectively. Using SNs in educational contexts, new forms of engagement between students and instructors are emerged. Such forms promote collaborative and informal learning where learning outcomes are reached through interaction and user-generated content. To this direction, teaching and learning become much more social. This paper analyzes the use of representative SNs for supporting social e-learning in higher education. For this purpose, learning applications were designed and developed using Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Elgg and Edmodo, and a comparative analysis was conducted. The main advantage of their adoption in education is that they support both formal and informal learning, as well as collaborative \u2026",

The GUI is called Intelligent File Manipulator (IFM) and it helps users with the management of their files and folders. IFM works in a similar way as a standard explorer such as Microsoft Windows 98 explorer, but it also incorporates intelligence. IFM is meant to act like a human expert that watches a user over the shoulder and offers advice spontaneously. It constantly monitors users' actions silently and generates automatic assistance when it diagnoses problematic situations. The generation of IFM's hypotheses about possible users' errors is based on an adaptation of a cognitive theory called Human Plausible Reasoning. As soon as the possible intended actions have been generated, the system uses a combination of the Human Plausible Reasoning theory with a multi-criteria decision making theory, called Simple Additive Weighting, in order to find the most appropriate action to be suggested to the user. The main focus of the evaluation of IFM is on the plausibility and usefulness of the advice selected through these methods as compared to the advice that human experts could provide if they watched the users working. The overall evaluation revealed that similarly to human experts, IFM could generate plausible hypotheses about users' errors to a satisfactory extent.",

The creation of user models is even more demanding in the area of Computer Assisted Multilanguage Learning, since modeling is an even more complex process that concurrently handles information from multiple domains. These domains have important similarities but also basic differences. This paper describes the implementation of student modeling through machine learning techniques, which aims to ameliorate future multiple language learning systems. The incorporation of k-means clustering is used to address several barriers posed by the heterogeneous learning audience. The resulting system both generates and discovers user profiles, based on students' characteristics, performance and preferences. Through \u2026",

However, the immediate availability of extensive resources for use by broad classes of computer users gives rise to new challenges in everyday life. These challenges arise from the fact that users cannot exploit available resources effectively when the amount of information requires prohibitively long user time spent on acquaintance with and comprehension of the information content. Thus, the risk of information overload of users imposes new requirements on the software systems that handle the information. Such systems are called Recommender Systems and attempt to provide information in a way that will be most appropriate and valuable to its users and prevent them from being overwhelmed by huge amounts of information that, in the absence of recommender systems \u2026",

Particularly, the output of HPR theory guesses all the possible command that the user may wants to type. These guesses can include many types of errors varying from typographic to wrong use of a legal command. In the presented mechanism, these guesses are input in a fuzzy reasoner, which takes into account the needs, characteristics and misconceptions of each individual user and decides about the most appropriate explanation of user's error and gives \u2026",

The system then initializes all aspects of the student model using the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. The basic idea of the application of the algorithm is to weigh the contribution of each of the neighbor students according to their distance from the new student; the distance between students is calculated based on a similarity measure.

            "Abstract": "One important field where mobile technology can make significant contributions is Education. In the fast pace of modern life, students and instructors would appreciate using constructively some spare time that they may have, in order to work on lessons at any place, even when away from offices, classrooms and labs where computers are usually located. In this paper, we describe a mobile authoring tool that we have developed and is called Mobile Author. Mobile Author can be used by human instructors either from a computer or a mobile phone to create their own Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and to distribute them to their students. After the ITSs have been created, students can also use any computer or mobile phone to have access to theory and tests. The tutoring systems can assess the students' performance, inform the data-bases that record the students' progress and provide advice adapted to the needs \u2026",

Of its provisions, the most radical and controversial one is the \u201cRight to be Forgotten\u201d (RtbF). In simple terms, the RtbF\u2014along with the provisions for withdrawing consent\u2014allows individuals, under certain conditions, to request the retroactive erasure of all of their personal data. In this chapter, we present the main data protection principles enshrined in the GDPR, and we explore the various notions of forgetting and the need to be forgotten\u2014including the case of revoking consent\u2014both in the social and in the technical context. In this regard, we review all controversies around the new stringent definitions of consent revocation and the RtbF in reference to their impact on privacy and data protection rights.

Individualisation may be achieved through student modelling, which is the main practice for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). In this paper, we show how principles of cognitive psychology have been adapted and incorporated into the student modelling component of a knowledge-based authoring tool for the generation of ITSs. The cognitive model takes into account the time that has passed since the learning of a fact has occurred and gives the system an insight of what is known and remembered and what needs to be revised and when. This model is individualised by using evidence from each individual student\u2019s actions.",

To demonstrate the re-usablility of UM-Server, we have used a common user model in three different applications of various domains, an e-learning system for health issues and two intelligent user interfaces, one for file manipulation and one for e-mailing. Despite the differences that exists between these domains, it is shown that the generalised method proposed can be successfully used by various applications.",

On the other hand educational syllabus may look quite dry to children and adolescents. In this paper, we describe VR-ENGAGE, a virtual reality game that has been constructed for teaching geography to students in a motivating way. Thus the captivating effects of electronic games may come into service to the purposes of education. The game is enriched with student modeling mechanisms that ensure the individualization of the interaction. The game has been evaluated and the results were very encouraging.",

            "Abstract": "Authoring tools for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have recently received a lot of attention from researchers in computer-based education. The reason for this is that they may provide environments where instructors may author their own ITSs in varying domains. In this way, painful constructions of ITSs, which may not be reusable, are avoided. However, the construction of an authoring tool is much more difficult than the construction of an ITS which is also considered difficult. Moreover, it is an area which is not yet well understood. In this paper we will report on an empirical study that we conducted in order to design and develop WEAR, an ITS authoring tool for Algebra-related domains. The study consisted of two phases where we investigated aspects concerning the attitude and behaviour of both students and instructors. This paper focuses on the parts of the study concerning the instructors. It also provides a brief description of the developed system\u2019s operation for the instructor in order to highlight how the resulting design specifications were put into practice.",

It has been widely acknowledged that computer assisted applications, which are made for educational purposes can be very beneficial for the students. In order to do that, such software has to be structured in such a way as to be highly adaptive and individualised to the needs of each student. The latest findings in this field of research show that, one important aspect of students in such software applications is affect (Goleman 1995). As a result affective user modeling is becoming essential. This paper describes how the Ortony, Clore & Collins (1988) cognitive theory of emotions can be adapted in an educational game, in order to model students\u2019 emotions while they learn. The system\u2019s inferences about students\u2019 emotions are used to adapt interaction to each individual student\u2019s needs.",

INTATU provides adaptive tutoring on Atheromatosis for various classes of users depending on their interests, background medical knowledge and computer skills. The adaptivity results from user modelling that is based on stereotypical knowledge about potential users (i.e., patients, patients relatives, doctors, medical students, etc. For the design of the system reasoning mechanism, and, thus, the successful incorporation of the decision making theory, an empirical study was conducted. As soon as the full functionality of the reasoning mechanism of the system was implemented, it was evaluated in comparison to the reasoning of human experts. The results of the evaluation offer strong evidence about the effectiveness of the reasoning mechanism and the overall operation of the system.",

I-Mailer constantly observes the user and in case it suspects that s/he is involved in a problematic situation it provides spontaneous advice. In particular, I-Mailer suggests alternative commands that the user could have given instead of the problematic one that s/he gave. The reasoning about which alternative command could have been best is largely based on the combination of the cognitive theory and MAUT.",

Immutability is considered a cornerstone of blockchains\u2019 security and, therefore, an indisputable property according to which transactional blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted. However, blockchain\u2019s immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR\u2019s \u201cRight to be Forgotten (RtbF)\u201d provision. Given that the RtbF compels data stored in blockchains to be editable so as restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be carried out when requested, blockchains\u2019 alignment with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not unfeasible. Towards resolving this discrepancy, in this Chapter we first discuss the privacy challenges faced by blockchain technology, and we then explore blockchain\u2019s contradiction \u2026",

When trying to incorporate an intelligent language learning system in social networks, a problem of user diversity emerges and thus, user clustering based on their characteristics is necessary. In view of this compelling need, this paper concerns the pattern discovery of user clusters in social networks. In this research, we have modeled the Facebook user characteristics that determine the clustering process. An unsupervised clustering algorithm was used so that coherent groups of users with the same learning styles and capabilities are generated. This algorithm clusters users by taking as input their several fundamental characteristics, such as their age, educational level, number of languages spoken and computer knowledge level. The general objective of this data mining process is to extract important information and to gain knowledge from the user data set and transform it into a manageable and intelligible structure with a view to ameliorating the learning process. These experimental results show that the Facebook user characteristics, which were chosen at the clustering process, seem to be significant determinants for the clusters and the whole learning experience of each user.",

However, there is a shortage of research in empirical work concerning the strengths and weaknesses of each modality so that more accurate recognizers can be built. In our research, we have investigated the recognition of emotions from the above mentioned modalities with respect to 6 basic emotional states, namely happiness, sadness, surprise, anger and disgust as well as the emotionless state which we refer to as neutral. We have found that certain states such as neutral happiness and surprise are more clearly recognized from the visual-facial modality whereas sadness and disgust are more clearly recognized from the audio-lingual modality.",

Typical approaches are not practical or require a high cost to implement. In contrast, we consider the concepts and their relationships discovered within an exchanged business document to find automatically an alignment to a local interpretation known as a document type. We present experimental results on applying Formal Concept Analysis as the ontological representation of documents, the Circle of Interest for selecting the most relevant document types to choose from, and Rough Set Theory for discerning among them. The results on a set of business documents show the feasibility of our approach and its direct application to a business domain.",

In this research, we have developed a system called\u2014EasyMath \u201c, a tutoring system for Algebra that incorporates intelligence. One of the primary aims of EasyMath is to make it useful in school classrooms. This is why, school teachers of mathematics and their students have been involved throughout the life cycle of EasyMath. The system was developed following the rational unified process, an object-oriented methodology for developing software through multiple iterations. The design of EasyMath has been based on the results of an empirical study that was conducted at schools and the resulting product was evaluated by school teachers as well as students.",

IFM has two underlying reasoning mechanisms: One is based on an adaptation of a cognitive theory called human plausible reasoning and the other one performs goal recognition based on the effects of users' commands. The requirement analysis of the system has been based on an empirical study that was conducted involving real users of a standard file manipulation program like the Windows Explorer; this analysis revealed a need for intelligent help.

This research is part of the construction of an active intelligent help system that monitors users in order to offer spontaneous help when they are facing problems. In order to ensure this, the help system must build and maintain a model of the user. We describe a mechanism that is used by the user modelling component of such a help system. This mechanism makes explicit assumptions about the user which account for different hypotheses about what the user is actually thinking at every stage of the interaction. The consistency of these assumptions is managed by an Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS). The selection between a number of different user models is based on the information which is extracted from the feedback that UNIX provides in response to user aCtlonS.",

The ICALL system is called Web-PVT and is a Web-based language tutor for the domain of the passive voice of the English language. The student modeling approach of Web-PVT considers the issue of language transfer of primary importance and exploits the fact that Web-based systems have a large and heterogeneous number of users. In particular, a machine learning reasoning mechanism is used, which is based on recognized similarities between users in order to predict the proneness of a new student to make mistakes of a particular type. The similarity between two students is calculated taking into account their mother tongue as well as other languages that they may already know. Thus, error proneness due to language transfer may be modeled.",

However, satisfactory progress has not yet been achieved towards the integration of these modalities, since the problem of combining them effectively is quite complicated. In our research, we combine the two modalities from the perspective of a human observer by employing a multi-criteria decision making theory for dynamic affect recognition of computer users. An important research milestone that is required in our approach is the specification of the strengths and weaknesses of each modality with respect to affect recognition concerning 6 basic emotion states.

Simple additive Weighting (SAW) is used for the recognition of possible emotional states of the users, while the cognitive theory of emotions (OCC) is used for the generation of emotional states by educational agents. The system bases its inferences about users\u2019 emotions on user input evidence from the keyboard and the microphone, as two commonly used modalities of human-computer interaction. The actual combination of evidence from these two modes of interaction has been performed based on a sophisticated inference mechanism for emotions and a multi-attribute decision making theory. At the same time, user action evidence from the two modes of interaction also activates the cognitive mechanisms of the underlying OCC model that proposes emotional behavioural tactics for educational agents who act for pedagogic purposes. The presented educational system provides the important facility to authors to develop tutoring systems that incorporate emotional agents who can be parameterized so as to reflect their vision of teaching behaviour.",

The actions suggested should be better than the problematic one in the context of the user's intentions as these are hypothesized by the system.

The game was built so that it could increase the students\u2019 motivation and engagement while they were taught. The evaluation of the educational game consisted of two parts: The first part consisted of a comparison between the Multi-Tutor Game and educational software with a conventional user interface but with the same underlying reasoning mechanisms as the Multi-Tutor Game. The second part aimed at finding out whether the Multi-Tutor Game could replace other computer games, which did not have any educational value in the children\u2019s preferences for their entertainment. The results in both parts of the evaluation were quite encouraging.",

In this Chapter, we delve into the privacy risks arising from the ubiquitous mobile computing and sensing applications and, in particular, from the big data algorithmic processing which infers sensitive personal details such as people\u2019s social behaviour or emotions. In this respect, we thoroughly discuss the risks of profiling which are further elaborated in the tax and financial context.

The system is called F-SMILE and is meant to help novice users learn how to manipulate the file store of their computer. F-SMILE consists of a Learner Modelling (LM) Agent, an Advising Agent, a Tutoring Agent and a Speech-driven Agent. The LM Agent constantly observes the learner and in case it suspects that the user is involved in a problematic situation it tries to find out what the cause of the problem has been. This is done by searching for similar actions to the one issued by the learner which would have been more appropriate with respect to the hypothesised learner\u2019s goals. These alternative actions are sent to the Advising Agent, which is responsible for selecting the most appropriate action to be suggested to the particular learner. The selection of the best alternative action is based on the information about the learner that the LM Agent has collected and a cognitive theory. In case the problem of the user was due to lack of knowledge, the Tutoring Agent is activated in order to generate adaptively a lesson appropriate for the particular user. When the advice and the corresponding lesson are ready, they are sent to the Speech-driven Agent, which is responsible for rendering the interaction with the user more human-like and user-friendly.",

Mobile technology provides software access from anywhere and at any time, as well as computer equipment independence.

Medical instructors are usually doctors that have to treat patients on top of their tutoring duties. Mobile features are complementary to web-based features for desktop computers to a high extend in asynchronous e-learning environments. Time and place independence is also a considerable potential for medical students with overloaded educational duties. This paper examines the degree of the usefulness of mobile facilities for medical instructors who wish to author and manage their courses by using a mobile authoring tool. Furthermore, this paper investigates how acceptable and useful the mobile features of an e-learning system have been to medical students who have used the system, in comparison with the use of the system through a desktop computer.

Although these three technologies have been widely used by researchers around the globe by academic disciplines and by R&D departments in the IT industry, they have not yet been used extensively for the purposes of education. The authors present a novel approach that uses adaptive hypermedia in e-learning models to personalize educational content and learning resources based on the needs and preferences of individual learners. According to reports, in 2018 the vast majority of internet users worldwide are active on social networks, and the global average social network penetration rate as of 2018 is close to half the population. Employing social networking technologies in the field of education allows the latest technological advances to be used to create interactive educational environments where students can learn, collaborate with peers and communicate with tutors while benefiting from a social and pedagogical structure similar to a real class. The book first discusses in detail the current trend of social networking-based learning. It then provides a novel framework that moves further away from digital learning technologies while incorporating a wide range of recent advances to provide solutions to future challenges. This approach incorporates machine learning to the student-modeling component, which also uses conceptual frameworks and pedagogical theories in order to further promote individualization and adaptivity in e-learning environments. Moreover, it examines error \u2026",

The authoring tool is called INMA and assists human tutors to create their own Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) for music education. Learner modeling in the resulting ITSs is primarily based on a cognitive theory that models human reasoning and is called Human Plausible Reasoning. The particular theory makes use of a very detailed knowledge representation of the domain of the part of music to be taught in the form of hierarchies, so that similarities, dissimilarities, generalizations and specializations among the tutoring concepts may be inferred. INMA incorporates a special knowledge acquisition component that can assist instructional designers on the task of constructing the music hierarchies required. The operation of this component is based on content-based retrieval and semantic meta-data.",

The education arena offers a fertile ground for data mining applications, since there are multiple sources of data and diverse interest groups. Thus, modeling student performance, can be a great tool for both educators as well as students, in order to make correct adjustments to the curriculum as well as the teaching methods. As a testbed for this study, four classification algorithms were chosen for comparison, namely the k-means algorithm, the - Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Support Vector Machines and the Naive Bayes Classifier. Though research algorithmic on performance has already being performed, a concrete conclusion has yet to be drawn. Therefore the focus of this study is to determine any differences and similarities that these algorithms may have on the data \u2026",

For this purpose, I-Mailer constantly reasons about every user action in terms of the user's goals and plans. In case the user is involved in a problematic situation, it transforms the user's problematic action and generates alternative actions to be suggested to the user. The actions suggested should be better than the problematic one in the context of the user's hypothesized intentions. However, this process usually results in the production of too many alternative actions that could be suggested to the user instead of the one issued.

This tutor is an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that operates on the WWW and aims at teaching non-native speakers the domain of the passive voice of the English language. It uses an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm to initialize the model of a new student. In particular, the student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/his knowledge level based on her/his performance on a preliminary test. The system then initializes all aspects of the student model using the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. The basic idea of the algorithm is to weigh the contribution of each of the neighbor students according to their distance from the new student \u2026",

However, the difficulty is to apply the same recommender and personalization techniques to a totally different system that belongs to a different domain and uses a different medium. Furthermore the difficulty level rises when we want to apply the previous recommendation techniques without changing major components or process attributes. In this paper we propose a server that can be used to achieve personalization to a product recommending system. The main advantage of this server is that works both for e-commerce and mobile commerce. We present a case study that we incorporated the user modelling server, which is a mobile e-shop, and discuss within the case the obstacles and breakthroughs we have achieved. The case study clearly shows that the same user modelling server can enhance e-shop application behaviour towards adaptivity and customer personalization.",

This set is called K.E.M.Cs and includes: knowledge, errors, motivation and cognitive states. It allows the system to identify the variety of backgrounds of prospective learners of programming, their misconceptions, needs and learning pace. The modeling of K.E.M.C.s is performed through a combination of different student modeling techniques: overlay, stereotypes, fuzzy logic and OCC cognitive theory. The gain of this approach is that the particular student model represents a sufficiently large part of the complex dimensions of a real student of programming. Therefore, it can be the base for the improvement of the quality of the learning process.",

To achieve this goal, the web-based educational system has to adapt dynamically to each individual student\u2019s needs and preferences. A solution to this is the student model, which allows the understanding and identification of each individual student\u2019s needs. In this chapter a novel student model, which is called F.O.S., is presented. F.O.S. combines three different student modeling approaches. It combines an overlay model with stereotypes and a rule-based mechanism. Furthermore, F.O.S. has been fully implemented in a web-based educational application, which teaches the programming language \u2018C\u2019. The particular hybrid student model allows each individual learner to complete the training program in her/his own learning pace and abilities.",

User friendly interfaces are even more important for the design of educational software that is appropriate for young children. In human-human interaction the expression of emotions of people can be evident in different modes of interaction, such as in speech, in body language, and in facial expressions. In human-computer interaction evidence about the users\u2019 emotional states can be drawn by the input devices each user uses for his/her interaction with a computer. In this paper we describe how two decision making theories have been combined in order to provide emotional interaction in an educational application. The resulting educational system is targeted to young children that are taught the basic principles of programming through our own implementation of a programming language called AffectLOGO.",

Following this direction, this paper presents a prototype Facebook application for learning which is supported by Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA is a generative model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that clarify why some parts of the data are similar. Hence, making automatic predictions about the interests of students can be made by collecting their preferences and characteristics. Hence, by tracking user interests, accurate recommendations can be made. The experimental results, presented in this paper, reinforce the view that automatic predictions using LDA to students in social networks can be a powerful idea in personalizing instruction.",

However, there is a shortage of research in empirical work concerning the strengths and weaknesses of each modality so that more accurate recognizers can be built. In our research, we have investigated the recognition of emotions with respect to 6 basic emotional states, namely happiness, sadness, surprise, anger and disgust as well as the emotionless state which we refer to as neutral. We have concluded that, in cases where a single modality may be deficient in providing emotion recognition evidence, the recognition process can be supported and complemented by the other modalities.",

To this end, a machine learning algorithm, namely k-means, is responsible for creating clusters relying on the system\u2019s pre-entered past data and as a next step, each new entry is assigned to the nearest centroid.",

The learning environment allows users to work in a protected way; it monitors their actions and reasons about them so that it can make hypotheses about what their real intentions have been and examine whether these have been met. In case the system believes that the user has made an error it informs him/her about the error and suggests alternative actions that would have met his/her real intentions. In this way, a novice user can learn from his/her mistakes. The system performs student modelling which is based on an adaptation and implementation of a cognitive theory called Human Plausible Reasoning.

As it is widely acknowledged, two or more modalities of interaction can provide complementary information to each other with respect to affect recognition. However, satisfactory progress has not yet been achieved towards the integration of these modalities, since the problem of combining them effectively is quite complicated. In our research, we combine the two modalities from the perspective of a human observer by employing a multi-criteria decision making theory for dynamic affect recognition of computer users. An important research milestone that is required in our approach is the specification of the strengths and weaknesses of each modality with respect to affect recognition concerning 6 basic emotion states. These emotion states are happiness, sadness, surprise, anger and disgust as well as the emotionless state which we refer to as neutral. For this purpose, we describe two empirical studies that we have conducted involving human users and human observers concerning the recognition of emotions from audio-lingual and visual-facial modalities. The results of the empirical studies have been used to assign weights to criteria for the application of a multi-criteria decision making theory. Moreover, the results of the empirical studies provide information that may be used by other researchers in the field of affect recognition.",

The system is called Web F-SMILE and is meant to help novice users learn how to manipulate the file store of their personal computer. In order to provide adaptive help and tutoring, Web F-SMILE has assigned an agent to constantly observe the user and collect information about him/her. This information is maintained centrally on a Learner Modelling Server. In this way, each learner model is available to any client application that requests it. The agents of the client applications interact with the Learner Modelling Server through Web Services. The main characteristic of Web Services is that they interact with the applications that invoke them, using web standards. Basing learner modelling on web standards has the advantage of enabling the dynamic integration of applications distributed over the Internet, independently of their \u2026",

One of them is the field of education, where the use of technological means allows alternative ways of teaching. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which has led to the closure of educational institutions in many countries, has increased the significance of educational platforms. Some platforms allow synchronous communication between the tutor and the student, i.e., the tutoring process takes place at a predetermined time, simulating conventional training. Asynchronous educational platforms enable the student to study and solve exercises in the time and at the pace of their own choice. However, there are questions about users\u2019 data, especially considering the General Data Protection Regulation  1  (GDPR) in force since 25 May 2018. In this article, we describe the features that distinguish synchronous from asynchronous \u2026",

Specifically, GLOSSA is a context-free language devoted to describe different forms of a kernel (Agent\u2192Action\u2192Patient) of a NL sentence based on its components, which are agents, actions, and patients, and for different kind of connections between them. GLOSSA is also able to describe different kinds of connections between more than one kernels in the same NL sentence. The definition of this formal language is motivated by our future goal to convert NL sentences onto state machines. In order to support this transformation we propose GLOSSA, which offers a formal model for the representation of basic components of a NL sentence (agents, actions, patients). Thus, in this work we provide the formal definition of the GLOSSA language and also present some illustrative examples of its use.",

Consequently, likeability may also be questioned. In this paper, we address the issue of usability and likeability of a virtual reality game that is meant to teach students geography.

In this paper we describe a framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based educational applications. The framework is called ISM. The basic idea of ISM is to set initial values for all aspects of student models using an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that \u2026",

The resulting system is affective by having the ability to recognize human emotional signals, as well as by being able to generate emotions for pedagogical educational reasons. Both for the recognition and for the generation of emotions within the educational environment we have incorporated two sophisticated theories that are used as mechanisms for human-machine emotional interaction. The first mechanism emerges from a well known decision making theory, while the second mechanism uses quite recent findings in the area of cognitive psychology. In our research, we have investigated the recognition of emotions from the above mentioned modalities with respect to six basic emotional states, namely happiness, sadness, surprise, anger and disgust as well as the emotion-less state which we refer to as neutral. The purpose of the incorporation of the supplementary emotional interaction between users and computers was to assist the educational processes in e-learning applications and also to support the instructors\u2019 work during their authoring duties.",

In order to provide better insights to the teacher we must develop more efficient tutoring systems that can process the large amount of data generated from the student interaction with the system. So far traditional analysis took into consideration structured data to provide feedback to the tutor. Data analytics, by examining patterns and correlations, try to transform data in a way that can be used for decision making. Similarly learning analytics analyze educational data obtained from student interaction with the system. Learning analytics can be of great benefit to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). In this paper we propose an analytics tool that gathers information from the student interaction with the system and feeds them to a search engine in order to provide better insights to the tutor.",

For this purpose, the student modelling process is based on principles of cognitive psychology. The resulting simulated students can be used to improve the software engineering process of the educational application and its performance. The software engineering process can be improved by the use of simulated students to evaluate educational software before it is delivered to real students. Moreover, the performance of the educational application can be improved since the simulated students can indicate how much new knowledge the real students may learn at a specific time and what needs to be reviewed. Thus, the system can plan the tutoring of new material and the revisions to be presented to students dynamically.",

The system teaches the domain of the passive voice of the English language and is called Web Passive Voice Tutor (Web-PVT). It dynamically models a student's progress in learning and is able to provide individualised tutoring and advice, tailored to a student's knowledge level and individual weaknesses. The initialisation of the student model is based on a multidimensional stereotype approach. However, after the individual student has interacted with the system sufficiently, the initial values provided by the stereotype are overwritten to reflect the individual student. This allows the system to adapt to each particular student.",

In our paper we describe an adaptive TV-shopping application that has been designed exclusively for people with impaired sight and hearing problems. The adaptivity of the application is achieved through a user modelling component that monitors users' actions and dynamically adapts the interaction to them depending on their inferred needs. The application learns from users' mistakes and tries to identify sight and hearing problems that such users may have. For this purpose, a clustering algorithm is used \u2026",

A crucial factor for adaptive systems is to provide adaptive navigation support through the links that constitute the learning material. Therefore, the system should advice each individual learner which domain concepts to read, taking into account her/his progress and performance on other related domain concepts. As a result, the system should be informed about the knowledge dependencies that exist among the domain concepts of the learning material, as well as the strength on impact of each domain concept on others. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) seem to be an ideal way for representing graphically this kind of information. However, due to the fact that a FCM usually is complex and there is a difficulty in extracting information of them, we suggest transforming them to a two-dimensional matrix, in which knowledge dependencies are analysed clearly through its rows and columns.",

This is usually due to the student modelling component that attempts to follow the student's way of learning taking into account possible misconceptions that the student may have. Other important dynamic features of ITSs are due to the advice generator that models the tutoring strategy by which the student is going to be taught the domain. However, ITSs have often been criticised that they represent immensely complex approaches to building learning environments (Boyle, 1997). A solution to this problem may be authoring tools that provide the facility of building multiple ITSs. In particular, as Murray (1999) points out ITS authoring tools may give the instructional designer a combination of facilities to produce visually appealing, interactive screens and a deep representation of content \u2026",

In order for authoring tools to benefit the most from the involvement of instructors, they should provide individualised feedback to them throughout the ITS\u2019s life cycle. In most cases the addition of an instructor modelling component to the architecture of an authoring tool may be very beneficial both for the quality of the ITSs to be produced and for the instructor himself/herself. Such an instructor modelling component could acquire information about instructors\u2019 preferences, interests and usual activities concerning the courses they author. In addition, it could acquire information about the instructors\u2019 level of expertise in particular domains as well as in the authoring process itself. In return it may use this information to increase adaptivity and provision of help to the instructor\u2019s needs. The main aim of this paper is to show that an instructor modelling component would be beneficial to all ITS authoring tools. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature and discuss the role that an instructor modelling component could have played in existing authoring tools if it had been incorporated into them. In addition, this paper also describes how an instructor modelling component has been incorporated in an authoring tool that we have developed, which is called WEAR.",

However, their development is a hard task and the end-result is difficult to evaluate. In this paper we present a novel approach for the evaluation of these systems, which relies on an agent that may be used as a simulated student-user. The evaluation agent incorporates modelling techniques of real users that are based on both cognitive and temperamental data. The cognitive model is based on cognitive psychology and simulates the memorisation and retention capabilities of a student. The temperamental data creates an image of the student concerning the way she/he behaves and the kind of personality she/he has. Developers may evaluate the tutoring systems using the agent rather that real students. Thus better quality of the end result may be achieved at no \u2026",

Web PVT incorporates techniques from Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Adaptive Hypermedia technologies to provide students with individualised instruction and feedback. The system uses stereotypes for the initialisation of the student model, which is then refined by observing the student while working with the system. The resulting student model is used for the annotation of the links to topics presented to the student.

However, in the fast and demanding pace of modern life, it is quite common finding people who learn to speak not only one but many foreign languages at the same time. Tutoring systems that support this kind of more demanding electronic teaching need to incorporate intelligence and also adaptation to the needs of their users. Both the creation and the successful incorporation of these user models into a tutoring system are accomplished through the implementation of the Voronoi iteration. In this way, users\u2019 characteristics define data points in Euclidean space and are grouped into a given number of categories using k-means clustering. A basic aim of this work is to utilize pre-stored information about past users in order to help future users learn more successfully and more efficiently.",

The basic idea of the proposed framework is to create student models in order to assist students in the simultaneous learning of multiple languages or mathematics. The system constructs an individual model for each student, which holds information about his/her knowledge level and the error proneness in the curriculum being taught. This framework is used to support each student while studying the theoretical section and getting evaluated. Furthermore, we describe the error diagnosis component, which tries to intelligently elicit information about the reason of a student error and builds accurately his/her individual profile. The tutoring component incorporates the order of teaching a curriculum or how to offer hints during problem solving. Finally, user modeling uses information which emanates directly from \u2026",

We introduce a general framework for the initialization of the student model in Web-based educational applications. According to the framework, the student modeler makes initial estimations of the new student's knowledge level and error proneness based on the models of other similar students. This is done by applying a machine learning technique. The similarity between students is calculated taking into account different student characteristics for different teaching domains. We have implemented the proposed methodology in two different tutoring domains, namely language learning and mathematics.

            "Abstract": "In this paper a knowledge representation approach of an adaptive and/or personalized tutoring system is presented. The domain knowledge should be represented in a more realistic way in order to allow the adaptive and/or personalized tutoring system to deliver the learning material to each individual learner dynamically taking into account her/his learning needs and her/his different learning pace. To succeed this, the domain knowledge representation has to depict the possible increase or decrease of the learner\u2019s knowledge. Considering that the domain concepts that constitute the learning material are not independent from each other, the knowledge representation approach has to allow the system to recognize either the domain concepts that are already partly or completely known for a learner, or the domain concepts that s/he has forgotten, taking into account the learner\u2019s knowledge level of the related concepts. In other words, the system should be informed about the knowledge dependencies that exist among the domain concepts of the learning material, as well as the strength on impact of each domain concept on others. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) seem to be an ideal way for representing graphically this kind of information. The suggested knowledge representation approach has been implemented in an e-learning adaptive system for teaching computer programming. The particular system was used by the students of a postgraduate program in the field of Informatics in the University of Piraeus and was compared with a corresponding system, in which the domain knowledge was represented using the most common used technique \u2026",

In welfare states, undeclared work results in loss of public revenue and thus resources critical for welfare mechanisms\u2019 funding, lack of worker protection and, last but not least, unfair competition for legitimate businesses. Yet, little to no studies have proposed the use of sophisticated machine learning methods in tackling this severe socioeconomic problem. In this study, we demonstrate the application of an advanced data analysis method, the association rule mining, which has significant advantages over rule-based systems, in classifying employers likely to engage in undeclared work. Indeed, the results of this pilot project proved divulging, even to the most experienced labour inspectors, offering insights in patterns of employers\u2019 illegal behaviour, that were previously unidentified.",

Web-EasyMath makes use of techniques inherited from the area of machine learning in both phases of the student modeling process. In particular, the initialization of the model of a new student is based on a novel combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Furthermore, Web-EasyMath maintains the model of each student using a data ageing mechanism as well as the history of the student\u2019s actions.",

This trend in the industry has resulted in the oversight of unexpected obstacles and consequently has affected the quality of embedded software. In order to prevent the oversight of unexpected obstacles, we have already proposed two methods for requirements analysis: the Embedded Systems Improving Method (ESIM) using an Analysis Matrix, and a method that uses an Information Flow Diagram (IFD). However, these analysis methods have been developed separately. This paper proposes the conceptual model including both methods, and clarifies abstraction mechanisms of expert engineers for extracting unexpected obstacles of embedded systems.

Virtual reality games and animated agents can provide high quality graphics that may play an important role to serve the aims of edutainment. However, since in edutainment the main aim of the software developed lies precisely on the combination of education and entertainment, there have to be appropriate evaluation methods that evaluate both these factors and assure that their combination is worth the effort and the development cost. So far, in the literature there have been evaluation frameworks that address each factor separately, but there is a shortage of frameworks on the combined role of education and entertainment of Virtual Reality games and animated agents. In this paper, I will survey current trends concerning the evaluation of educational software and Virtual Reality games and animated agents and will speculate \u2026",

Therefore, EVA (Earned Value Analysis) has received a lot of attention recently as a method for managing a project in an integrated fashion by introducing a unified metric called EV (Earned Value) and quantitatively measuring and analyzing the cost and schedule of a project. Project managers can use EVA to estimate SEAC (Schedule Estimate At Completion) and EAC (Estimate At Completion). However, there are several constraints inherent in a software development plan, and any software development plans have to satisfy the constraints. Therefore, SEAC and EAC are estimated by using EVA and by taking account of the constraints,, and the estimation result by the former is compared with the estimation result by the latter. As a result, it turns out that EVA quite often generates inaccurate estimations for SEAC and EAC. In this way, this paper clarifies problems of a method for estimating SEAC and EAC by EVA.",

Given the variety of backgrounds of prospective learners of programming, developing learning environments for all of them is not easy. In the light of these problems, this work has focused on the development of an original integrated e-training environment for programming and the language C, incorporating a student model responsible for identifying and updating the student's knowledge level, which takes into account each individual user's pace of learning.

Furthermore, properly identified reviews present a baseline of information as an input to different systems, such as e-learning systems, decision support systems etc. However, the data preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis, since selecting the appropriate preprocessing methods, the correctly classified instances can be increased. In view of the above, this research paper explains the necessary information to get preprocess the reviews in order to find sentiment and make analysis whether it is positive or negative. Extended comparison of sentiment polarity classification methods for Twitter text and the role of text preprocessing in sentiment analysis are discussed in depth.

The reasoning of the user modelling component of IFM is largely based on an adaptation of a cognitive theory, called Human Plausible Reasoning (HPR). HPR is combined with techniques that refer to the individual user and stereotypes. In addition, IFM incorporates a goal recognition mechanism. The goal recognition mechanism is based on a notion called \u2018instability\u2019. IFM has been evaluated in comparison with human experts acting as consultants. The results of the evaluation have shown that IFM can successfully improve human-computer interaction by producing advice helpful to users.",

            "Abstract": "In order to improve the quality of software, we review specifications refined from the specifications of the previous design process. Nevertheless, errors and defects of specifications are sometimes detected during testing processes. According to our research, we\u2019ve found that the internal design specifications have more defects than other specifications. Most of those defects were embedded during the refining process from the external design to the internal design. The aim of our research is to detect those defects by reviewing the internal design specifications. One of the difficulties of reviews is that reviewers trace an item in the external design specifications to an item in the internal design specifications. In order to solve the difficulties, we defined two metamodels and a relationship model between those specifications by analyzing the templates of design specifications. The metamodels represent the structure with items of external design specifications and internal design specifications. The relationship model represents dependency between items in an external design specification and an internal design specification. The metamodels and the relationship model were evaluated by review checklists. This paper shows those models and the result of our evaluation. We conclude that the review checklist derived from the models can list up review perspectives more effectively than conventional checklists.",

AUTO-COLLEAGUE provides personalised and adaptive environment for users to learn UML. Users are organized into working groups under the supervision of a human coacher/trainer. The system constantly traces the performance of the learners and makes inferences about user characteristics, such as the performance type and the personality. All of these attributes form the individual learner models, which are built using the stereotype theory. User modelling is applied in order to offer adaptive help to learners and adaptive advice to trainers aiming to support them mainly in forming the most effective groups of learners.",

Its aim is to test the functionality and usability of the design and to identify and rectify any problems (Dix et al. 1993). In particular, formative evaluation is one of the most critical steps in the development of learning materials because it helps the designer improve the cost-effectiveness of the software and this increases the likelihood that the final product will achieve its stated goals (Chou 1999).

This process gives the system an insight of what is known and remembered and what needs to be revised and when.

Simple additive Weighting (SAW) is used for the recognition of possible emotional states of the users, while the cognitive theory of emotions (OCC) is used for the generation of emotional states by educational agents. The system bases its inferences about users\u2019 emotions on user input evidence from the keyboard and the microphone, as two commonly used modalities of human-computer interaction. The actual combination of evidence from these two modes of interaction has been performed based on a sophisticated inference mechanism for emotions and a multi-attribute decision making theory. At the same time, user action evidence from the two modes of interaction also activates the cognitive mechanisms of the underlying OCC model that proposes emotional behavioural tactics for educational agents who act for pedagogic purposes. The presented educational system provides the important facility to authors to develop tutoring systems that incorporate emotional agents who can be parameterized so as to reflect their vision of teaching behaviour.",

            "Abstract": "Adaptivity in training software systems is of great importance as it can adjust one single training environment to the needs of each individual trainee. ASSET is such a UML training software system as it provides adaptive support to both the trainer and the trainees. Specifically, it provides an environment that can be parameterised by the trainer to suit the training needs of his/her company or educational institution. The adaptive help to the trainer concerns mainly advice on the best schemes of collaboration between the trainees and the most efficient and productive forming of group as well. The adaptive help destined for the trainee refers to knowledge, user type and personality attributes. The special characteristic of ASSET is that it does not base its inferences on specific tests, but constantly monitors every action of the trainees during their interaction with the system",

This is achieved by the technology of student modeling. One prevalent technique of student modeling is stereotypes. Furthermore, individuals differ in how they learn. So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students\u2019 preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a method for confirming quality requirements considerations in a design document. The method enables software designers to avoid the oversight and the overabundance about the design related to quality requirements. To evaluate the method, we applied the method to several commercial software systems, and confirmed the method worked well.",

M DOCs and LMSs are currently being used widely at all levels of education for the delivery of both distance and blended learning. Quite a lot of research energy has been put during the last decade in extending the capabilities of LMSs to make them adaptive to learners according to their knowledge, needs, preferences, and characteristics. However, limited are the works that are concerned with the other class of users, i.e the instructors/course authors. In this paper, we argue that instructors should be provided with individualized feedback, support, and guidance throughout the life cycle of their LMS courses and that this could be achieved by a system incorporating an instructor modelling component.",

Affective ITSs are expected to provide a more human-like interaction between students and educational software. The ITS is named Edu-Affe-Mikey and its tutoring domain is Medicine. The two modes of interaction presented in this chapter concern the keyboard and the microphone. Emotions of students are recognised by each modality separately and then, evidence from the two modalities is combined through a decision making theory. After emotion recognition has been performed Edu-Affe-Mikey adapts dynamically its tutoring behaviour to an appropriate emotion of an animated tutoring agent. In this respect an affective and adaptive interaction is achieved in the interactions of the student with the ITS, by performing both affect recognition and affect generation.",

For the evaluation of all the modules of POLYGLOT, the Kirkpatrick\u2019s Four-Level Evaluation Model and the statistical hypothesis test were used. The results of the evaluation were very encouraging.

This has been approached by incorporating principles of a cognitive theory in a Graphical User Interface (GUI), that deals with file manipulation and is called IFM. The cognitive theory is called Human Plausible Reasoning (HPR) and has been used to simulate users\u2019 reasoning in the user model of the system so that the GUI may provide spontaneous assistance to users\u2019 errors. Such a goal is difficult to achieve and depends heavily on the development process. However, there is a shortage of reports on the software engineering process of intelligent assistants. Moreover, in the literature of intelligent assistants there is evidence that some important phases of their development process may have been omitted and thus the understanding of delicate issues has not improved significantly. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on presenting and discussing the software engineering process of the intelligent assistant developed. Special emphasis has been put on the description of the experimental studies, which were conducted prior and after the development of the system. Theses studies were used for the specification and refinement of the overall design as well as the adaptation of HPR in it. The experimental results have shown that the intelligent assistant may follow the users\u2019 reasoning and provide helpful advice to a satisfactory extent as compared to human advisors.",

The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and present research on the recognition via computer of emotions and/or the mood of a single person or groups of people by using a visual-facial modality combined with a keyboard-based modality. Additionally, this chapter presents research about a program that recognizes the emotions/mood of groups of people in live pictures collected directly from webcams. New algorithmic approaches are proposed and conclusions are drawn for use in similar systems. The implemented system successfully recognizes emotions in the \u2026",

Recent scientific literature has shown that computer-supported collaborative learning may lead to expected learning outcomes. Placing students in situations where they need to engage in effortful interactions to build a shared understanding, fully integrated in pedagogical scenarios, is a significant activity of our system. In conjunction with collaboration, our system offers adaptivity to students' needs via the student modeler. The collaborative activity is designed to support teaching in groups and is intended to create inter-dependencies among students through the error diagnosis component. Activity and tools are designed for teaching multiple languages in an interactive environment where advice from system and group members \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper describes the evaluation of a speech-driven cartoon agent that has been embodied in the interface of a Web-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) authoring tool. The agent is mainly used in the student interface of the ITSs that are produced by the authoring tool and represents either a student or an instructor. The agent was evaluated during an experiment in terms of the effect that it could have on students\u2019 interaction with the generated ITSs. The participants in the experiment were divided into three groups: one third of them worked with a version of the ITS in which the agent was supposed to be an instructor, another third worked with a version of the ITS in which the agent was acting as a costudent and the rest worked with an agent-less version. The results from this study seem to confirm the hypothesis that a pedagogical agent incorporated in an ITS can improve students\u2019 experience. On the other hand, the hypothesis that the presence of the agent significantly enhances learning was rejected based on our data. Comparing the two agent versions of the co-student and instructor, the most important finding was that students seem to feel more comfortable working with a virtual costudent than with a virtual instructor.",

            "Abstract": "One of the primary aims of educational software is to be used in real school classrooms. However, a lot of educational software has been criticised that has not been designed to meet the needs of real schools settings. The above criticisms show that there is a need to introduce research results of educational technology into the environment of real classrooms. A solution to this problem may be the involvement of school teachers in the development of an ITS (Virvou & Tsiriga 1999a) and the application of evaluation methods on every stage of the tutoring system's life cycle. In this way we can ensure usability and learning effects. For the purpose of this research, a multimedia tutoring system was developed. The system is called EasyMath and incorporates intelligence. EasyMath's model of life cycle has been based on Object Unified Process (Kruchten 1999), an object oriented process that suggests multiple iterations \u2026",

For this purpose, a system that provides affective interaction based on evidence from two different modes has been developed. More specifically, the system\u2019s inferences about students\u2019 emotions are based on user input evidence from the keyboard and the microphone. Evidence from these two modes is combined by a user modelling component that incorporates user stereotypes as well as a multi criteria decision making theory. The mechanism that integrates the inferences from the two modes has been based on the results of two empirical studies that were conducted in the context of knowledge engineering of the system. The evaluation of the developed system showed significant improvements in the recognition of the emotional states of users.",

In particular, WEAR maintains instructor models for the human instructors who author the ITSs in order to adapt the interaction with each instructor and provide individualised support to them throughout the ITS\u2019s lifecycle. The instructor modelling component may then be used to promote the collaboration among instructors who share the same interests. In this paper, we report on an evaluation study that we conducted in order to examine the necessity and added value of the existence of an instructor modelling component in WEAR\u2019s architecture. The results of the study are in favour of this component. Almost all instructors found useful to consult other peers through sharing the design of the course in order to redesign their course for future use. Furthermore, they showed interest in seeing the courses that were created by expert peers rather than courses created by novice ones.",
