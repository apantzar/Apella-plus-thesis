            "Abstract": "We study the design and radiation performance of novel miniature antennas for integration in head-implanted medical devices operating in the MICS (402.0-405.0 MHz) and ISM (433.1-434.8, 868.0-868.6 and 902.8-928.0 MHz) bands. A parametric model of a skin-implantable antenna is proposed, and a prototype is fabricated and tested. To speed-up antenna design, a two-step methodology is suggested. This involves approximate antenna design inside a simplified geometry and further Quasi-Newton optimization inside a canonical model of the intended implantation site. Antennas are further analyzed inside an anatomical human head model. Results indicate strong dependence of the exhibited radiation performance (radiation pattern, gain, specific absorption rate and quality of communication with exterior equipment) on design parameters and operation frequency.

In this study, texture differences were estimated along the atherosclerotic arterial wall, namely at the plaque, the wall adjacent to it and the plaque shoulder, i.e. the boundary between wall and plaque, in an attempt to reveal morphological phenomena, representative of the high stenosis (considered vulnerable) cases. A total of 25 arteries were interrogated, 11 with low (50-69%) and 14 with high (70-100%) degrees of stenosis. The two groups had similar ages. Texture features were estimated from B-mode ultrasound images, and included four second-order statistical parameters (contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity), each calculated at four different image directions (00, 450, 900, 1350), yielding a total of 16 features.

            "Abstract": "Improvements in medical imaging technology have greatly contributed to early disease detection and diagnosis. However, the accuracy of an examination depends on both the quality of the images and the ability of the physician to interpret those images. Use of output from computerized analysis of an image may facilitate the diagnostic tasks and, potentially improve the overall interpretation of images and the subsequent patient care. In this paper, Analysis, a modular software system designed to assist interpretation of medical images, is described in detail. Analysis allows texture and motion estimation of selected regions of interest (ROIs). Texture features can be estimated using first-order statistics, second-order statistics, Laws' texture energy, neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix, gray level difference statistics, and the fractal dimension. Motion can be estimated from temporal image sequences using block \u2026",

In this study, we numerically assess the telemetry link between a biocompatible dual-band implantable antenna and an external receiver. Two telemetry scenarios are examined: with and without the presence of an intermediate relay antenna. Use of the relay antenna is proposed towards a more stable and reliable telemetry link. Its aim is to improve the energy efficiency of the implant, while limiting the electromagnetic exposure of biological tissues. The antenna is considered to be implanted inside the human head for Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring applications.",

The inverse scattering problem is solved by minimizing the difference between an integral representation of the scattered field and the measured data, subject to nonlinear equality constraints imposed by the SIE for the field in the interior of the scattering object. Indicative numerical results are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

We use a segment of appropriately selected and processed data recorded from five nuclei to acquire the information of the spike timing and rhythm of a single neuron and estimate the model parameters. We then use the rest of each recording to assess the model's accuracy in predicting spike timing, rhythm, and interspike intervals. We show that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the predicted spikes remains inside the 95% confidence interval of the CDF of the recorded spikes. By training the model appropriately, we prove its ability to provide quite accurate predictions for multiple-neuron recordings as well, and we establish its validity as a simple yet \u2026",

We propose, here, a new meta-classifier approach which combines several different combination methods, in analogy to the combination of simple classifiers.

Strain maps of the same segments were produced by compensating for the translational movement of the carotid artery walls and subsequently assessing the strain tensor by solving a nonlinear minimization problem with a modified version of the WLSOF algorithm. Displacement maps accurately estimated the motion of the healthy carotid artery and also revealed information about the motion of the soft tissues of the carotid artery which would \u2026",

The P50 was evoked by two tones of low and high frequency (500 Hz and 3000 Hz). The group with developmental disorders of scholastic skills showed prolonged P50 latency induced by the low tone, located at the frontal area. The amplitude of P50 induced by the low tone exhibited significantly negative associations with both age and memory performance, whereas age and memory performance were associated positively.

In this study, texture (morphological) characteristics were investigated in a sample of asymptomatic male subjects, at the atheromatous plaque, the adjacent arterial wall and the plaque shoulder, i.e. the boundary between plaque and adjacent wall. A total of 25 arteries were interrogated, 11 with low (50-69%) and 14 with high (70-100%) degrees of stenosis. The two groups had similar ages. Texture characteristics were estimated from systolic and diastolic B-mode ultrasound images, and included four second-order statistical parameters (contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity), each calculated at four different image directions (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0 \u2026",

The standard method for excluding the scatter component in pixelized scintillators is the application of an energy window around the central photopeak channel of each crystal cell, but small angle scattered photons still appear in the photopeak window, and they are included in the reconstructed images. A number of scatter correction techniques have been proposed in order to estimate the scatter component, but they have not yet been applied in pixelized scintillators, where most groups use the standard one-photopeak window for scatter correction.

Its crucial engagement with the neurosurgical procedure of deep brain stimulation (DBS) that alleviates medically intractable Parkinsonian tremor augments the need to refine our current understanding of it. Intranuclear recordings, received from a patient during surgery, are processed to acquire both local field potentials (LFPs) and the spiking activity of the cells inside the nucleus. Under the physiologically justified assumption that the LFPs constitute the input of the cells inside the nucleus whereas the spikes are the output, an input output system analysis of the STN is straightforward. Primary results show that a non-linear Hammerstein-Wiener model is able to simulate the STN output with a reasonable accuracy.",

However, the susceptible accuracy of placement of the DBS electrode inside the brain nucleus determines the therapeutic efficacy of the method. Unlike normal cases, untreated Parkinsonian states in basal ganglia structures produce oscillations at various frequencies, the most prominent of which is a synchronization in the beta frequency band recorded in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).

The interplay between these factors determines the wireless communication link range and bandwidth, battery lifetime, and electronics technology. The size restrictions limit the power consumption of an IMD and as a result functionality is limited. Moreover, the size dictates the dimensions of the antennas and their radiation efficiency. Powering of IMDs is usually performed by an inductive link (Harb et al., 2004), but other types of power delivery have been reported (Olivo et al., 2011). Besides power, in many applications there is a need for bidirectional communication through the same set of coils or another type of communication link [eg, high-frequency radio frequency (RF) transmission] as shown in Figure 2.1. Different modulation techniques have been used to transmit data to and from IMDs. The most important factor in the design process is to keep the power consumption in the implant as low as possible. Another consideration is the frequency and power transmitted by the carrier, which is limited due to the absorption of the higher frequency RF signals by the tissue (Olivo et al., 2011). This results in a limitation to high data rates, which require higher carrier frequencies. It is also desirable to have a simple demodulator for the data link from the transmitter to the implant (downlink) which is placed in",

A multiscale edge detection methodology is used for the definition of an initial snake contour, followed by a gradient vector flow (GVF) snake. The multiscale edge detection method is based on finding the local maxima of the wavelet transform of the image, which is very close to the real contour. The GVF snake is based on the calculation of the image edge map and the calculation of the GVF field which guides the deformation for the estimation of the real arterial wall boundaries. In twenty cases of healthy carotid arteries the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were higher than 0.97, 0.99 and 0.98 respectively, for both diastolic and systolic cases.

            "Abstract": "In the present paper, a new methodological approach, for the classification of first episode schizophrenic patients (FES) against normal controls, is proposed. The first step of the methodology applied is the feature extraction, which is based on the combination of the multivariate autoregressive model with the simulated annealing technique, in order to extract optimum features, in terms of classification rate. The classification, as the second step of the methodology, is implemented by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the backpropagation algorithm under \"leave-one-out cross-validation\". The ANN is a multilayer perceptron, the architecture of which is selected after a detailed search. The proposed methodology has been applied for the classification of FES patients and normal controls using as input signals the intracranial current sources obtained by the inversion of event-related potentials (ERP \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Motion of the carotid artery wall is important for the quantification of arterial elasticity and contractility and can be estimated with a number of techniques. In this paper, a framework for quantitative evaluation of motion analysis techniques from B-mode ultrasound images is introduced. Six synthetic sequences were produced using 1) a real image corrupted by Gaussian and speckle noise of 25 and 15 dB, and 2) the ultrasound simulation package Field II. In both cases, a mathematical model was used, which simulated the motion of the arterial wall layers and the surrounding tissue, in the radial and longitudinal directions. The performance of four techniques, namely optical flow (OF HS ), weighted least-squares optical flow (OF LK(WLS) ), block matching (BM), and affine block motion model (ABMM), was investigated in the context of this framework. The average warping indices were lowest for OF LK(WLS)  (1.75 \u2026",

Four decomposition schemes, namely, the discrete wavelet transform, the stationary wavelet transform, wavelet packets (WP), and Gabor transform (GT), as well as several basis functions, were investigated in terms of their ability to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. The mean and standard deviation of the detail subimages produced for each decomposition scheme were used as texture features. Feature selection included 1) ranking the features in terms of their divergence values and 2) appropriately thresholding by a nonlinear correlation coefficient. The selected features were subsequently input into two classifiers using support vector machines (SVM) and probabilistic neural networks. WP analysis and the coiflet 1 produced the highest overall classification \u2026",

The methodology aims to adjust the design of a parametric dual-band antenna model towards optimally satisfying the requirements imposed by the antenna-fabrication procedure and medical application in hand. Design is performed in a systematic, fast, and accurate way. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed methodology is applied to optimize the parametric antenna model for intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitoring given a specific antenna-fabrication procedure. For validation purposes, a prototype of the optimized antenna is fabricated and experimentally tested. The proposed antenna is further evaluated within a 13-tissue anatomical head model in terms of resonance, radiation, and safety performance for ICP monitoring. Extensive parametric studies of the optimized antenna are, finally, performed. Feasibility of the proposed parametric antenna model to be optimally re-adjusted for various scenarios is demonstrated, and generic guidelines are provided for implantable antenna design. Dual-band operation is targeted to ensure energy autonomy for the implant. Finite Element (FE) and Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations are carried out in homogeneous rectangular and anatomical head tissue models, respectively.",

The above services will be provided through the combined use of already evaluated systems. These systems supports capabilities for ultrasound images, ECGs, vital signal measurements, video conference, and elearning, along with communication gateways for data transmission over ISDN/DSL, satellite, GPRS, and WLAN networks. Furthermore, the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) infrastructure to support proposed system\u2019s interoperability will provide the fundamental basis for future collaboration and information technology projects in the area.Manuscript received August 10, 2006.

In this paper, a Fourier volume rendering (FVR) method is proposed, enabling real time preview of DRR. Important aspects related to re-sampling into the frequency domain are examined, leading to results of high quality. Experiments using phantom and clinical data sets are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method for a real time execution. Furthermore, due to the inherent parallelism of the proposed algorithm, its execution time can be further reduced by distributing the required computations to more than one processors. The computational efficiency of the method highlights its suitability for integration into a web-based radiation treatment planning (RTP) system, using a client-server architecture. Thus, platform independent, real time tele-cooperation in clinical radio-oncology can be achieved.",

            "Abstract": " Summary: The identification of unknown amino acid sequences of peptides as well as protein identification is of great significance in proteomics. Here, we present a publicly available web application that facilitates a high resolution mapping of measured molecular masses to peptides and proteins, irrespectively of the enzyme/digestion method used. Furthermore, multi-filtering may be applied in terms of measured mass tolerance, molecular mass and isoelectric point range as well as pattern matching to refine the results. This approach serves complementary to the existing solutions for protein identification and gives insights in novel peptides discovery and protein identification at the cases where the identification scores from the other approaches may be below significance threshold. Peptide Finder has been proven useful in proteomics procedures with experimental data from MALDI-TOF \u2026",

The roots of modeling a body area date back thousands of years, yet it was not until the 1950s that the tree of knowledge started to be fed with data-driven hypotheses and interventions. This chapter tries to organize disparate information of the most important modeling, simulation, and control perspectives into a coherent set of views currently applied to modern biological and medical research. It is addressed to researchers on human system physiological modeling, working both in academia and in industry to address current and future research goals.",

            "Abstract": "In Medical Imaging, registration between two (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) images is a common problem encountered when more than one image of the same anatomical structure is obtained, either using different imagery or performing dynamic studies. In all cases, the information present in the different images must be combined to produce fused or parametric images [1]. Registration can be performed between two modalities with anatomical information (CT-CT or CT-MRI), between anatomical atlases and dynamic studies (CT-PET, CT-SPECT etc.)[2]-[7] or between images of the same modality, taken at different times [8]-[9]. This chapter considers the registration problem in two cases: retinal image registration (2-D case) and registration of CT-MR images of the brain (3-D case). Ophthalmologists commonly compare Red-Free (RF) retinal images, which is a reference image taken without intravenous injection \u2026",

The data processing is usually performed using contact mechanics models at the linear elastic regime such as the Hertz model. It should be noted that the cells' response can be considered as linearly elastic only for a limited range of indentation depths. Although there are in literature proposed values of the maximum allowed nanoindentation depth for most of the cell types, these values have been mostly derived empirically. As a result, the use of these empirically obtained findings can result in significant errors regarding Young's modulus calculations. A large number of measurements, using spherical and conical indenters, showed errors in the range of 4\u2212 10% with respect to the Young's modulus calculation.

The accuracy of different optimization strategies based on a variety of similarity measures (cross-correlation, mutual information coefficient or chamfer distance) is assessed by means of statistical tests. Results from every optimization procedure are quantitatively evaluated with respect to the gold-standard (manual) registration. The comparison has shown that chamfer distance is a robust and fast similarity measure that can be successfully combined with common optimization techniques in retinal image registration applications.",

To assist in vitro testing, a low-cost technique is proposed for reliably measuring the electric properties of liquids without requiring commercial equipment. Validation is performed within a specific prototype fabrication/testing approach for miniature antennas.

CDS systems aim to codify and strategically manage biomedical knowledge to handle challenges in clinical practice using mathematical modelling tools, medical data processing techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. CDS systems cover a wide range of applications, from diagnosis support to modelling the possibility of occurrence of various diseases or the efficiency of alternative therapeutic schemes, using not only individual patient data but also data on risk factors and efficiency of available therapeutic schemes stored in databases. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can enhance the diagnostic capabilities of physicians and reduce the time required for accurate diagnosis.

We hypothesized that a data-informed combination of features extracted from intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) can predict the motor improvement of Parkinson's disease patients undergoing DBS surgery. We modified the employed RFs to account for unbalanced datasets and multiple observations per patient, and showed, for the first time, that only five neurophysiologically interpretable MER signal features are sufficient for predicting UPDRS improvement. This finding suggests that subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrophysiological signal characteristics are strongly correlated to the extent of motor behavior improvement observed in STN-DBS.",

Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a decision support system\u2013based on artificial neural networks (ANN) technology\u2013for the classification of patients experiencing FES compared to healthy controls, utilizing the P600.Method: We examined 14 FES patients and 23 healthy controls, matched for age, sex and educational level. The proposed system comprises two levels: the feature extraction level and the classification level. The former is based on the implementation of an autoregression model to estimate the corresponding coefficients, which form the input vector for the later level. The classification level consists of a multi-layer neural network. Results: The performance of the system in terms of classification rate has been tested for a total of 15 abductions of each subject and for a specific order of the autoregression model according to the modified Schwarz criterion. The best classification rate, up to 100% has been achieved for the (C4-T6)/2 abduction compared to the other abductions and for all the subjects. Furthermore, the performance of the classifier for this abduction is consistent against the other adductions and for all the specific orders of the autoregression model implemented.Conclusions: The findings indicate that activities related to the P600 component during a WM task and explored by the proposed system may be involved in FES.

Furthermore, an improved Rytov approximation is developed for the description of the unknown internal          field in the scattering integral equation. The inverse scattering problem is then solved by minimizing the squared error between measured and predicted values for the scattering amplitude. The efficiency          of the direct and inverse scattering technique is validated by using synthetic scattering amplitude data, and a study of noise effects is undertaken. It is shown that significant improvement over conventional          diffraction tomography methods based on the first-order Rytov approximation is \u2026",

In this study, a sophisticated motion analysis algorithm, namely weightedleast-squares optical flow combined with multiscale image analysis, was used in an attempt to produce valid displacement maps of selected areas of the arterial wall. Elastography was subsequently applied to estimate strain maps of the same arterial/image areas.Materials and Methods. B-mode ultrasound images of the carotid artery were used as input to the suggested methodology. Compared to radio-frequency (rf) data, which are commonly used in elastography studies, B-mode data are more easily available and contribute to reduced computational cost. Displacement and strain maps were produced in the radial as well as in the longitudinal directions over two-three cardiac cycles.Results. Reproducible elastograms were obtained as a function of time for both healthy and atherosclerotic segments of the arterial wall. In the healthy cases, the expected uniform displacements and strains were found for the radial direction, exhibiting compression and dilation for cardiac systole and diastole, respectively; somewhat less homogeneous displacements and strains were found for the longitudinal direction. In the plaque cases, increased variability was observed in both displacement and strain maps, probably reflecting the different mechanical behavior of various plaque materials.Conclusion. The suggested approach is promising for quantifying the mechanical/elastic behavior of the healthy and, more importantly, of the diseased carotid artery wall.",

The aim of the current work is to study the complex etiology beneath obesity and identify genetic variations and/or factors related to nutrition that contribute to its variability. To this end, a set of more than 2300 white subjects who participated in a nutrigenetics study was used. For each subject a total of 63 factors describing genetic variants related to CVD (24 in total), gender, and nutrition (38 in total), e.g. average daily intake in calories and cholesterol, were measured. Each subject was categorized according to body mass index (BMI) as normal (BMI \u2264 25) or overweight (BMI > 25). Two artificial neural network (ANN) based methods were designed and used towards the analysis of the available data. These corresponded to i) a multi-layer feed-forward ANN combined with a parameter decreasing method (PDM-ANN), and ii) a multi-layer feed-forward ANN trained by a hybrid method (GA-ANN) which combines genetic algorithms and the popular back-propagation training algorithm. PDM-ANN and GA-ANN were comparatively assessed in terms of their ability to identify the most important factors among the initial 63 variables describing genetic variations, nutrition and gender, able to classify a subject into one of the BMI related classes: normal and overweight. The methods were designed and evaluated using appropriate training and testing sets provided by 3-fold Cross Validation (3-CV) resampling.

The results from these changes were compared with the ones from the previous version of our scatter algorithm, Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data. The phantoms (and their arrangement) used to acquire the experimental data consisted of small spheres, so as to enable us to isolate the scatter effect from the other coincidences.

A Hough-transform-based methodology is used for the definition of the initial snake, followed by a gradient vector flow (GVF) snake deformation for the final contour detection. The GVF snake is based on the calculation of the image edge map and the calculation of GVF field which guides its deformation for the estimation of the real arterial wall boundaries. In twenty cases there was no significant difference between the automated segmentation and the manual diameter measurements. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.97, 0.99 and 0.98, respectively, for both diastolic and systolic cases. In conclusion, the proposed methodology provides an accurate and reliable way to segment ultrasound images of the carotid artery.",

For this purpose an optimal range of total injected activity levels can be determined by employing the performance parameter of the Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR). NECR is defined as a metric of the rate in which statistically important coincidence events are counted by a PET system. The NECR depends on the total amount of injected activity and demonstrates a peak value for a certain range of activity levels.

            "Abstract": "Biotelemetry systems use sensors which provide physical, chemical, and biological data for the continuous remote monitoring of human physiological parameters. Among other applications, biotelemetry is applied for the monitoring of high-risk patients through the monitoring of crucial physiological parameters such as heart rate, pulse waveform, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, intracorporal pressure, gastrointestinal chemical parameters, or lumen visualization. In the late 1950s wireless communication technologies began to be applied for measuring the pH and the temperature from internal cavities and also for applications involving subcutaneous and implantable sites, though with several limitations (Farrar et al., 1957). Later, during the 1970s, several systems were developed, such as devices for fetal monitoring, electrocardiogram telemetry, and gastrointestinal pressure monitoring (Ko and Neuman, 1967; Neuman et al., 1970; Koet al., 1971). Hewlett Packard developed a portable electrocardiograph in 1972, the HP71800A, for ECG monitoring on a 24-h basis. Since then, several biotelemetry devices have been developed. A critical parameter for all the biomedical telemetry applications is the sensing operation and especially the power feed of the wearable or implantable device. Other challenges include the size, the sampling rate, and the reliability of measurements. The hardware of these sensors usually comprises a microcontroller, an ultralow-power RF transceiver, antennas, analog signal conditioning circuitry, data converters, and",

Design is performed inside a small-sized single- or multilayer tissue box for the single-layer tissue model (SLTM) and the multilayer tissue model (MLTM) variations, respectively. Given a specific medical application scenario, the idea is to take into account the dielectric loading of the surrounding tissues and exterior air on the antenna while using an adequately small tissue model to speed up simulations. Effectiveness of the methodology is assessed for antenna design aimed at intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and cardiac pacemaker applications. The MLTM variation provides more accurate results than the SLTM at the expense of being slightly more complex and slow.",

Brain mapping techniques are able to provide evidence for the solution of debatable issues in cognitive science. In this paper, a two-step signal classification approach is proposed, extending the use of the Low Resolution Brain Electrical Tomography (LORETA) inversion technique. The first step concerns the feature extraction module, which is based on the combination of the Multivariate Autoregressive model with the Simulated Annealing technique. The classification module, as the second step of the methodology, is implemented by means of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained with the backpropagation algorithm under \u201cleave-one-out crossvalidation\u201d. The ANN is a multi-layer perceptron, the architecture of which, is selected after a detailed search. The proposed methodology has been applied for the classification of first episode schizophrenic patients and normal controls using as input signals the intracranial current sources obtained by the inversion of ERPs using the LORETA technique. Results by implementing the proposed methodology provide classification rates of up to 93.1%. Finally, the proposed methodology may be used for the design of more robust classifiers based on the head-surface measured potentials as well as on the intracranial source locations, which directly relate to cognitive mechanisms.",

Both AFOF and MAFOF were evaluated through their application to synthetic image sequences of the common carotid artery. Multiscale image analysis increased the accuracy in motion tracking, with MAFOF yielding average displacement error reductions of 9% with respect to AFOF.

Canonical as well as realistic exposure problems are considered and solved using a novel accurate semianalytical method or Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations. The semi-analytical method combines the theory of Green\u2019s functions with the Method of Moments (Green/MoM) and permits the analysis of the interaction between homogeneous or layered spherical human head models and arbitrarily shaped wire antennas, such as helical or linear dipoles. The accurate semi-analytical character of the Green/MoM technique provides a powerful tool for benchmarking of purely numerical techniques, such as the FDTD, which has proven to be the most efficient numerical technique for treating problems related with mobile communication dosimetric assessment. Then, FDTD simulations are carried out to evaluate the characteristics of power absorption in an anatomically detailed human head model exposed to a realistic handset equipped with a small size helix monopole. The results of Green/MoM and FDTD simulations include calculations of local and average specific absorption rates (SAR\u2019s) inside the human head, total power absorbed by the head and assessment of antenna radiation patterns at 1710 MHz. Furthermore, the results obtained for helical antennas are assessed against results obtained for linear antennas (ie half-wavelength linear dipole and quarter wavelength linear monopole mounted on the top of a realistic handset) using Green/MoM and FDTD simulations.",

In this paper we describe a web-based radiotherapy treatment planning (WBRTP) system to facilitate decentralized radiotherapy services by allowing remote treatment planning and quality assurance (QA) of treatment delivery. Significant prerequisites are digital storage of relevant data as well as efficient and reliable telecommunication system between collaborating units. The system of WBRTP includes video conferencing, display of medical images (CT scans, dose distributions etc), replication of selected data from a common database, remote treatment planning, evaluation of treatment technique and follow-up of the treated patients.

The dopaminergic denervation of the striatum, due to substantia nigra neuronal loss, compromises the speed, the automatism and smoothness of movements of PD patients. The development of a reliable tool for long-term monitoring of PD symptoms would allow the accurate assessment of the clinical status during the different PD stages and the evaluation of motor complications. Furthermore, it would be very useful both for routine clinical care as well as for testing novel therapies. Within this context we have validated the feasibility of using a Body Network Area (BAN) of wireless accelerometers to perform continuous at home gait monitoring of PD patients.

Vessel wall motion, caused by blood pressure, blood flow and tethering to the surrounding tissue, may be responsible for tissue rupture and cerebrovascular symptoms. B-mode ultrasound allows non-invasive recording of arterial wall and plaque motion in two directions, namely radial and longitudinal. Temporal sequences of ultrasound images, recorded at high frame rates, can be used to quantitatively estimate movement of the arterial wall. Motion of the carotid artery wall and plaque from sequences of ultrasound images has been estimated using block matching and optical flow techniques. Block matching is based on tracking blocks of pixels, assuming that the blocks remain constant over time and motion. Optical flow relies on the estimation of the \u2026",

We utilized the intranuclear MER to acquire the local field potential (LFP) and drive an Izhikevich model of an STN neuron. Using the model as the test bed for clinically acquired data, we demonstrated that stimulation of the STN neuron produces excitatory responses that tonically increase its average firing rate and alter the pattern of its neuronal activity.

            "Abstract": "Electromagnetic fields or energies of frequencies that range from 0 Hz to 1 THz (1 THz= 1012 Hz) have wavelengths longer than 1 \u03bcm in air. Furthermore, at wavelengths close to the micrometer limit of the spectrum, electromagnetic energy behaves as infrared radiation. These wavelengths produce photons (or quanta) of low energy; therefore, under ordinary circumstances, the energy in a photon is too low to break chemical bonds, excite electrons, or produce ionization of biological molecules. Consequently, they are often referred to as low-energy or nonionizing radiation. Electromagnetic energies propagate through a material medium (including biological medium) at a constant speed in that medium. For example, they propagate through air or vacuum at the speed of light, that is, at 2.998\u00d7 108 m/s. Moreover, electromagnetic energies with wavelengths longer than 10 m (frequencies lower than 30 MHz) have interaction properties that differ greatly from those of wavelengths that are approximately equal to or less than the physical dimensions of a human body.Although living organisms thrive in a natural electromagnetic environment, they are increasingly subjected to a myriad of human-made nonionizing radiation in the form of electromagnetic fields and waves for telecommunication uses, industrial and medical applications, and many other purposes. For example, the radiofrequency (RF) band of 300\u201330,000 kHz (or 0.3\u201330 MHz with wavelengths from 1000 m to 10 m) is used in medicine for ablating, coagulating, and cauterizing tissue.

To this end, positive interference arising from various sources has extensively been employed during the last decades, based on the use of continuous wave signals. In this context, phased array principles and optimization techniques have been applied to develop hyperthermia systems for the treatment of malignant tumors and mainly the low microwave spectrum (100-1000 MHz) has been employed [1]-[4]. However, these techniques suffer from the excessive attenuation of each wave radiated from each individual source and from the side effects created by the coupling phenomena between array source elements [5]. The possibility of employing pulsed signals to improve focusing properties has been suggested by various researchers, using as an additional system parameter the time delay between array signals. Although limited information is presently available on the behavior of propagation of pulsed signals, the behavior arising from precursor phenomena is expected to be useful in focusing electromagnetic waves. The propagation of a pulsed signal inside dispersive dielectric media has received widespread treatment by the use of asymptotic analysis [6], transform techniques [7], time-domain integral equation solvers [8], the finite-difference time-domain algorithm [9\u201311] and Fourier series based approaches [12].

A random walk based algorithm is then utilized to recognize the fold of a query protein sequence by calculating its affinities to sequences-vertices both in the initial and the optimized PSeSN.

Comprehensive surveys of medical image registration can be found in [1] and [2], in terms of image modalities and employed techniques. The process of image registration can be formulated as a problem of optimizing a function that quantifies the match between the original and the transformed image. Several image features have been used for the matching process, depending on the modalities used, the specific application and the implementation of the transformation. The registration process can be divided into three main categories: point-based, surface-based and volume-based methods. Point-based registration involves the determination of the coordinates of corresponding points in different images and the estimation of geometrical transformation using these corresponding points. Such points can be defined using external markers placed on the patient's skin before the acquisition [3-4], stereotactic frames [5-6) and landmarks [8]. Surface-based registration involves the determination of the surfaces of the images to be matched and the minimization of a distance measure between these corresponding surfaces. The surfaces are generally represented as set of large number of points obtained by segmenting contours in contiguous image slices. There may be a requirement for the points to be",

To this end, simulations using an accurate semi-analytical method, based on the combination of the Green\u2019s functions theory with the Method of Moments (Green/MoM), as well as the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method have been carried out. Green/MoM simulations concern three layered-scalp/cranium/brain tissuespherical head models and are used to produce the worst-case estimation of human head exposure to the field generated by a helical dipole antenna. FDTD simulations are used to study the interaction between a heterogeneous anatomically correct model of the human head and a normal mode helix monopole mounted on the top of a metal box representing a realistic mobile communication terminal. The study of both canonical and realistic exposure problems includes computations of specific absorption rates (SARs) inside the human head, total power absorbed by the head and assessment of antenna performance.

            "Abstract": "The possibility of developing an antenna system consisting of transmit and receive arrays and being able to work simultaneously in full duplex mode at the same frequency is a very attractive task. This could only be achieved if the isolation between the transmit and receive arrays is sufficiently high not to cause a parasitic oscillation which will ruin the proper operation of a transponder system to which the arrays will be connected. Specifically, in this paper the operation of two peripheral open waveguide arrays placed on a cylindrical surface and being isolated with a radial line operating as a space filter, is studied. In analyzing the radiation properties of this rather complicated array antenna which has a conformal structure, an integral equation technique is used, while the solution of the derived set of equations is obtained by using a Galerkin approach. The accuracy of the developed solution is verified by several tests such as energy conservation theorem, convergence patterns and comparison with results obtained by applying the physical theory of diffraction technique. In addition to the theoretical analysis, an experimental antenna system has been developed and measured. Comparison of theoretical and experimental results is carried out and the validity of the solution is verified.",

Both crystals were compared to CsI:Tl scintillator, used in X-ray and gamma-ray imaging. LYSO:Ce and GSO:Ce are high density (7.1 g/cm/sup 3/ and 6.71 g/cm/sup 3/ respectively), high atomic number (71 for Lu and 64 for Gd), non-hydroscopic, and short decay time (40 ns and 60 ns respectively) scintillators. CsI:Tl is a slightly hygroscopic, high light yield (/spl ges/10/sup 4/ photons/MeV) scintillator but of relatively slow decay time (>200 ns). Evaluation was performed by determining: 1) the absolute luminescence efficiency (emitted light flux over incident X-ray exposure) in X-ray energies employed in general X-ray imaging (40-140 kV) and in mammographic X-ray imaging (22-49 kV), 2) the light emission spectrum, determined at various X-ray energies (22 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The problem of inverse scattering is a fundamental one in the field of mathematical physics. In inverse scattering, one attempts to determine the properties of an inhomogeneous medium from the knowledge of the scattered field outside the medium, assuming that the incident field is also known. When the term \u201cproperties of the medium\u201d is mentioned, the shape of the medium and the distribution of the refractive index within the medium are meant. The efficient solution of the inverse scattering problem is of paramount importance in numerous applications, such as medical tomography, non-destructive testing, target identification, remote sensing, seismic exploration and atmospheric sciences. Unfortunately, the inverse scattering problem is inherently non-linear, as a result of multiple scattering within the object. Furthermore, it is also ill-posed thus making its numerical solution even more difficult [1]. Unless regularization methods are employed, the existence of noise in the scattered field data can further exacerbate the difficulty of solving the inverse problem. One of the main aspects to be considered is that of the uniqueness of the solution. Although it has been shown that under certain conditions the inverse scattering problem has a unique solution, the problem of the existence of a solution in the general case is still a subject of investigation [1]. However, the main concern in inverse scattering problems should be whether an approximate solution can be found, since in any realistic situation the scattered field data will always be contaminated with noise, therefore an exact solution to the inverse problem cannot be obtained.

            "Abstract": "The motion of the carotid artery wall has been previously estimated from ultrasound image sequences using block matching. In this paper, this conventional method was extended through its combination with Kalman filtering in two distinct scenarios; (a) by renewing the reference block and (b) by updating the estimate of the conventional algorithm. Both procedures were evaluated on synthetic image sequences through the estimation of the warping index. The results showed that incorporation of the Kalman filter in conventional block matching slightly improved the accuracy in arterial wall motion estimation. Updating the estimate of the conventional algorithm using Kalman filtering was the most efficient procedure and could be used to study further the displacements of the arterial wall in an attempt to obtain useful knowledge about arterial biomechanics.",

Wireless Intra-cranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring devices have been proposed for sub-dural and epidural implantation. The proposed devices overcome several limitations of existing wired techniques, providing great benefits for next-gen wireless ICP devices. In this work, we evaluate the telemetry link performance between a miniature biocompatible implantable antenna and an exterior dipole in MedRadio band. Moreover, we numerically assess the safety performance of the proposed antenna in terms of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and temperature increase in the surrounding head tissues.",

To this end, various motion indices representing velocity, amplitude and diastole-to-systole displacement, and texture features based on firstand second-order statistics were estimated. Associations were revealed by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the statistical significance of the results was validated through permutation tests. It was concluded that (a) heterogeneous material composition of the plaque reduces its movement in the radial and longitudinal directions, probably because of interactions between different materials and (b) bright image regions (echogenic materials) moved more intensely in the longitudinal direction than darker image regions (anechoic materials), while the opposite was observed for motion in the radial direction.

The lack of interoperability between Health Information Systems (HIS) does not allow the physicians to acquire all the necessary data for the diagnostic process. In this paper, a semantically-aided architecture is proposed for a web-based monitoring system for carotid atherosclerosis that is able to gather and unify heterogeneous data with the use of an ontology and to create a common interface for data access enhancing the interoperability of HIS. The architecture is based on an application ontology of carotid atherosclerosis that is used to (a) integrate heterogeneous data sources on the basis of semantic representation and ontological reasoning and (b) access the critical information using SPARQL query \u2026",

Applications and mechanistic understanding have continued to receive growing attention in this arena due to issues relating to therapies, health risks and hazards, biosensing, and medical delivery technologies. Biological sensory systems can detect very weak steady fields. For example, variations as small as a few percentage of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field (5\u00d7 10\u2212 5 T) can be detected (Lohmann and Lohmann 1996), while sharks and rays sense extremely weak electric fields in seawater. However, the effects of weak fields are difficult to understand and any possible role in triggering or coordinating coupled biophysical mechanisms in organized cell systems is challenging to analyze. Thus, molecular changes or signaling induced by low fields can be difficult to extract and discern from other sources of change such as natural biochemical pathways. By",

In this study, we investigate whether a linear modification of the LFPs, acquired from microelectrode recordings inside the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of Parkinson's disease patients, can provide input to an appropriately parameterized Izhikevich model to predict the spikes of an STN neuron. We show that the model is able to predict both the exact timing and the rhythm of the recorded spikes with high accuracy in 5 out of 7 intranuclear single neuron recordings. For the rest of the models, one model shows a lower accuracy in predicting the rhythm and the second one shows a lower accuracy in predicting the timing of the spikes. Overall, the results dictate that the LFPs can reliably predict the occurrence of spikes.",

            "Abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to study energy differentiations of electroencephalogram (EEG) and event related potentials (ERP) of normal subjects and subjects with dyslexia. As ERP is considered to be nonstationary signal, traditional spectral analysis is not recommended. A most appropriate approach is time-frequency representation (TFR) which reveals temporal evolution of frequency components. In this study a non-orthogonal, iterative method for adaptive timefrequency approximation of signals called matching pursuit is used. This method decomposes the signal piece by piece using a dictionary of basis functions. At each step the best fitting analyzing function is adapted to an intrinsic structure of the signal, thus providing flexible signal representation. The major advantages of the matching pursuit are the good localization of transients, the robust universal estimate of the time-frequency energy density which is resistant to the existence of noise and the fact that the dictionary set of waveforms is not limited to a single basis. Time frequency statistics reveal statistical differences on energy distribution of specific time intervals and frequency components over time-frequency plane. Possible non-normal distributions of the energy values are taken into account and a normalization transform is used in order to be able to use robust parametric tests. According to this analysis, dyslexics appear to have statistically reduced energy compared to controls for frequency regions 5-20Hz and for time around the ERP component N100.",

            "Abstract": " The proposed interactive segmentation method can be used to facilitate faster and consistent creation of annotations for large-scale studies, to enable subsequent computational analyses. The proposed method combines strengths of expert-based annotations and machine learning. We seek the development and evaluation of a fast, accurate, and consistent method for general-purpose segmentation, based on interactive machine learning (IML). To validate our method, we identified retrospective cohorts of 20 brain, 50 breast, and 50 lung cancer patients, as well as 20 spleen scans, with corresponding ground truth annotations. Utilizing very brief user training annotations and the adaptive geodesic distance transform, an ensemble of SVMs is trained, providing a patient-specific model applied to the whole image. Two experts segmented each cohort twice with our method and twice manually. The IML method was faster than manual annotation by 53.1% on average. We found significant (p < 0.001) overlap difference for spleen (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.91/0.87), breast tumors (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.84/0.82), and lung nodules (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.78/0.83). For intra-rater consistency, a significant (p = 0.003) difference was found for spleen (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.91/0.89). For inter-rater consistency, significant (p < 0.045) differences were found for spleen (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.91/0.87), breast (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.86/0.81), lung (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.85/0.89), the non-enhancing (DiceIML/DiceManual = 0.79/0.67) and the enhancing (DiceIML/Dice \u2026",

The holistic and evidence-based CEHRES Roadmap, used to create eHealth solutions through participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques and business modelling, was adopted in the MOSAIC project to define the sequence of multidisciplinary methods organized in three phases, user needs, implementation and evaluation. The research was qualitative, the total number of participants was ninety, about five-seventeen involved in each round of experiment. Prediction models for the onset of T2D are built on clinical studies, while for T2D care are derived from healthcare registries. Accordingly, two set of DSSs were defined: the first, T2D Screening, introduces a novel routine; in the second case, T2D Care, DSSs can support managers at population level, and daily practitioners at individual level. In the user needs phase, T2D Screening and solution T2D Care at population level share similar priorities, as both deal with risk-stratification. End-users of T2D Screening and solution T2D Care at individual level prioritize easiness of use and satisfaction, while managers prefer the tools to be available every time and everywhere. In the implementation phase, three Use Cases were defined for T2D Screening, adapting the tool to different settings and granularity of information.

            "Abstract": "In this study, we numerically assess detuning issues for an ingestible antenna which is designed to operate in the Medical Device Radiocommunications Service (MedRadio, 401-406 MHz), as it travels along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. For this purpose, we evaluate the antenna resonance performance within four canonical single-tissue models of the human esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine. The antenna is further placed at different locations within the aforementioned tissue models in order to assess detuning issues related to its relative positioning within each of them. Inherent detuning issues are observed and discussed in the four different simplified tissue models considering three specific locations of the antenna in each model, resulting in twelve different scenarios. The resonance, radiation and safety performance of the ingestible antenna is, finally, evaluated.",

In this chapter, a review is attempted regarding the analysis and quantification of motion within the cardiovascular system from sequences of images. The main sources of cardiovascular wall motion include blood pressure, blood flow and tethering to surrounding tissue. The most commonly applied techniques for cardiovascular motion analysis include feature-based and pixel-based methodologies; the latter further include block matching, optical flow and registration techniques. Two distinct paradigms based on these methodologies are highlighted, namely myocardium and carotid artery wall motion. The current status of research in these areas is reviewed and future research directions are indicated.",

            "Abstract": "The interaction between an arbitrarily shaped wire antenna and a three-layer lossy dielectric sphere, representing a simplified model of the human head, is analyzed theoretically. The proposed technique is based on the theory of Green\u2019s functions in conjunction with the Method of Moments (Green/MoM). The Green\u2019s function of the three-layer sphere can be calculated as the response of this object to an elementary dipole of unit dipole moment. The antenna is simulated with the aid of Method of Moments. Appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on the surface of the antenna leading to a linear set of equations. The solution of the linear system determines the unknown coefficients arising from the MoM technique. Then the electric field at any point in space, including the interior of the sphere, as well as other parameters of interest (ie, the current distribution, the input impedance, the radiation pattern of the antenna) can be calculated. The main purpose of this analysis is to provide a reliable tool for the solution of specific canonical problems referring to the dosimetric evaluation of potential health hazards in mobile telecommunications. The semi-analytical character of the proposed method permits the benchmarking of purely numerical techniques applied to more realistic head geometries. Finally the developed method can be used to evaluate different antenna designs.",

The sequence of fixations extracted is further used to identify the part of the image that will mostly attract visual attention.

The established method for dosimetry is based on the measurement of the biokinetics by serial gamma camera scans, followed by calculations of the administered activity and the residence times, resulting in the radiation absorbed doses of critical organs. However, the quantification of the activity in different organs from planar data is hampered by inaccurate attenuation and scatter correction as well as due to background and organ overlay (Glatting 2006). Alternatively, dosimetry based on quantitative three-dimensional data is more accurate and allows a more individualized approach, provided that all effects that degrade the quantitative content of the images have been corrected for.

Over this range of applications the sensitivity and the energy resolution of a PET system can be critical, as it can possibly affect the minimum amount of activity which can be reliably detected. Clinical PET systems, as opposed to small animal systems, are less sensitive and, therefore, imaging of very low activity sources could be challenging. Moreover the presence of LSO crystal detectors can further raise the minimum detection threshold due to the intrinsic radioactivity of the  176 Lu contained in the LSO compound. Our aim is to examine the feasibility of using an LSO-based clinical PET scanner for imaging activity distributions of 4nCi/mm 3  or less. In this study the parameter of minimum detectable activity (MDA) has been used for the quantification of the detection \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Motion extracted from the carotid artery wall provides unique information for vascular health evaluation. Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion corresponds to the multiphasic arterial wall excursion in the direction parallel to blood flow during the cardiac cycle. While this motion phenomenon has been well characterized, there is a general lack of awareness regarding its implications for vascular health assessment or even basic vascular physiology. In the last decade, novel estimation strategies and clinical investigations have greatly advanced our understanding of the bi-axial behavior of the carotid artery, necessitating an up-to-date review to summarize and classify the published literature in collaboration with technical and clinical experts in the field. Within this review, the state-of-the-art methodologies for carotid wall motion estimation are described, and the observed relationships between longitudinal motion \u2026",

Various screens were prepared in our laboratory from YAP: Ce powder (Phosphor Technology, Ltd.), with coating thickness ranging from 53 to 110 mg/cm2. The imaging performance of the screens was assessed by experimental determination of the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the noise transfer function (NTF). MTF was determined by the edge spread function (ESF) method while NTF was estimated by noise power spectrum (NPS) measurements after uniform screen irradiation. In addition, parameters related to overall image quality, such as the signal-to-noise ratio transfer (MTF/NTF), were estimated. MTF curves were affected by the beam hardening effects caused by the patient simulating 20 mm thick aluminum \u2026",

The problem of inverse scattering is a fundamental one in the field of mathematical physics and consists of finding the refractive index distribution of an inhomogeneous medium from the knowledge of the scattered field away from the medium, assuming that the incident wave is known. In this work, a novel inverse scattering method based on a spectral domain method of moments technique is presented, suitable for biological objects imaging. The interaction of the incident field with the scattering object is described in terms of the Lippmann-Schwinger scattering integral equation. The unknown total wavefield inside the scattering object is expressed as a superposition of a relatively small number of global domain basis functions (i.e. plane waves), while the unknown object function is expanded in a set of spatially shifted Gaussian basis functions.

The N100 component of event-related potentials (ERP) is thought to reflect attention and working memory operation. However, previous studies showed controversial results concerning the N100 in dyslexia. Variability in this issue may be the result of inappropriate match up of the control sample, which is usually based exclusively on age and gender. In order to address this question the present study aimed at investigating the auditory N100 component elicited during a WM test in 38 dyslexic children in comparison to those of 19 unaffected sibling controls. Both groups met the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). ERP were evoked by two stimuli, a low (500 Hz) and a high (3000 Hz) frequency tone indicating forward and reverse digit span respectively. As compared to their sibling controls \u2026",

Methods to reduce the total amount of radioactive dose injected into a patient are investigated.

Through dose optimization, a compromise between the total dose injected into a patient and the required scan time can be achieved, by ensuring maximum count rate performance for the scanner. In this study, we use the Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR) as a metric of the rate in which statistically important coincidence events are counted by a PET imaging system.

However, the relationship between fMRI signals and spiking activity can be inferred indirectly provided that the LFPs can be used to predict the spiking activity of the area. Until now, only the LFP\u2013spike relationship in cortical areas has been examined.

Initially, correspondences between points, belonging to a properly chosen pair of the available slices, are established. These correspondences are used to guide a procedure for creating a slice that is an approximation of the interpolated slice. The same procedure is applied for the other pair of slices resulting in another approximation of the interpolated slice.

            "Abstract": "The fact that carotid atherosclerosis is the most common cause of stroke, coupled with the exceptionally high levels of mortality, morbidity, and disability for stroke events, places a valid risk stratification for the disease among the major public health challenges. The unique features of ultrasound imaging have established it as the cornerstone in the diagnosis and monitoring of carotid atherosclerosis, while ultrasound has also demonstrated a substantial potential in providing novel, automated, risk markers, valuable in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment selection for the disease. This chapter aims to leverage the use of kinematic analysis from B-mode ultrasound toward a better understanding of the mechanical phenomena taking place in atherosclerotic carotid arteries, recognizing the vulnerable carotid plaque, and studying potential different kinematic phenotypes of the disease. To this end, we first present a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We read with interest in our vascular department the article by Kadoglou et al. 1 Although it is a novel marker to be studied in the setting of carotid arteries, there are considerable fallacies in the aim, methodology, and the conclusions drawn. We wish to draw attention to only some salient ones in this communication. The introduction with a reference states that \u201cGalectin-3, propagates vascular inflammation by inducing the expression of proinflammatory mediators in macrophages and the migration of monocytes into vascular walls\u201d. However the conclusion states that \u201cthe findings support the hypothesis that galectin-3 is predominantly an anti-inflammatory mediator in advanced carotid plaques\u201d. The primary or secondary aim of the study does not involve the grey-scale median; however, it is extensively used in the results and discussion.

The semi-analytical method is based on the combination of Green's functions theory with the method of moments (Green/MoM) and is able to model arbitrarily shaped wire antennas radiating in the close proximity of layered lossy dielectric spheres representing simplified models of the human head. The purpose of the development of the Green/MoM technique is to provide a reliable tool for preliminary (worst case) estimation of human head exposure to the field generated by different antenna configurations with emphasis on the helical antenna, representing the most diffused antenna type used in modern cellular handsets.

The proposed approach is based on a generic rule, able to triangulate all 15 standard cube configurations used in the classical MC algorithm as well as additional cases presented in the literature. The proposed implementation of the MC algorithm can handle the Type A \u2018hole problem\u2019 which occurs when at least one cube face has an intersection point in each of its four edges. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the new implementation to reproduce standard MC results, resolving Type A \u2018hole problem\u2019. Finally, the proposed implementation was applied to real medical date to reconstruct anatomical structures. The output of the proposed technique is in WWW compliant format.",

The reconstruction of the object function is then obtained by minimizing the squared error between measured and predicted values for the scattered field.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal may be able to play an important role in the diagnosis of dyslexia. The Approximate Entropy (ApEn) is a recently formulated statistical parameter used to quantify the regularity of a time series data of physiological signals. In this paper, we initially estimated the ApEn values in signals recorded from controls subjects and dyslectic children. These values were firstly used for the statistical analysis of the two groups and secondly as feature input in a classification scheme. We also used the cross-ApEn methodology to get a measure of the asynchrony of the signals recorded from different electrodes.

The FBP algorithm has been extensively used to solve the two-dimensional inverse-scattering problem under the first-order Born and Rytov approximations for weak scatterers. The extension of this algorithm in three dimensions is not straightforward, because the task of collecting the data needed to obtain a low-pass filtered version of the scattering object, taking into account all spatial frequencies within a radius of radic2k 0 , and of incorporating these data to the FBP algorithm, needs to be addressed.

The tissues dielectric properties are varied, based on data measurements and age-related empirical formulas, found in literature. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations are conducted for layered flat phantoms coupling with dipole antennas operating at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz. Anatomical MRI-based human head models in the proximity of mobile handsets equipped with monopoles are also studied. Results revealed that the effect on the SAR values is strongly dependent on the exposed tissue distribution and does not always lead to higher SAR values in younger persons.",

International clinical guidelines for the management of Type 2 DM (T2DM) are founded on primary and secondary prevention and favor the evaluation of CVD-related risk factors towards appropriate treatment initiation. CVD risk prediction models can provide valuable tools for optimizing the frequency of medical visits and performing timely preventive and therapeutic interventions against CVD events. The integration of explainability modalities in these models can enhance human understanding on the reasoning process, maximize transparency and embellish trust towards the models\u2019 adoption in clinical practice.

            "Abstract": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is one of the subcortical nuclei that constitute the basal ganglia and a pivotal point of their function and dysfunction. In this paper, we use intranuclear recordings, acquired intraoperatively during deep brain stimulation procedure, to investigate whether it is possible to infer STN spike trains using only the underlying local field potentials (LFPs). We regard the LFPs to be the input and the spikes to be the output of a simple Hammerstein-Wiener model and we show that STN spikes can indeed be inferred from intranuclear LFPs, at least with moderate success. Our model, although not always reliable when predicting exact spike positions, shows a good accuracy in predicting the up to 1 kHz structure in STN spike trains. Hence, intranuclear LFPs can indeed hold useful information for predicting STN spiking activity.",

For multiscale WLSOF (MWLSOF), ultrasound images were initially decomposed at one level using a 2D discrete wavelet transform, and WLSOF was applied on the resulting approximation images; the result was `translated' to the original images through a coarse-to-fine transition process. WLSOF and MWLSOF were evaluated on synthetic image sequences of the common carotid artery. Multiscale image analysis increased the accuracy in displacement estimation, with MWLSOF yielding average displacement error reductions of 14% with respect to WLSOF. The methods were also effectively applied to real ultrasound image sequences of the carotid artery. It was concluded that \u2026",

This fact implies that any part of a fractal object is a scaled down copy of the original. However, for natural objects the self-similarity is observed only for a limited range of scales and it appears in a statistical sense. In this case, a part of the object, magnified to the size of the original, exhibits similar statistical properties to the original. The numerical quantification of self-similarity is obtained by the fractal dimension.The fractal dimension is a measure of the roughness of the surface represented by the fractal set: the larger the fractal dimension is the rougher appears the surface.

The semi-analytical technique combines the Green\u2019s functions theory with the Method of Moments (Green/MoM) and is able to model arbitrarily shaped wire antennas radiating in the close proximity of layered lossy dielectric spheres representing simplified models of the human head. The purpose of the development of an accurate semianalytical technique is to provide:(1) a powerful tool for preliminary (worst case) estimation of human head exposure to the field generated by different antenna configurations and (2) a testbed for bencmarking of purely numerical techniques, such as the FDTD which has proven to be the most efficient numerical technique for problems related with mobile communication dosimetric assessment. First, the interaction between spherical head models and a half wavelength linear dipole or a normal mode helical antenna, is studied. Then, after appropriate benchmarking, FDTD simulations are used to examine the coupling between a heterogeneous anatomically correct model of the human head exposed to either a quarter wavelength linear monopole or a normal mode helix monopole, both operating at 1710 MHz and mounted on the top of a metal box representing a realistic mobile communication terminal.

The mean value of RLs is used to reveal edge regions in mammograms. The edges produced would be discontinued and resemble mostly to edge segments.

The principal concept of MMAS is the utilization of unknown current and charge density distributions on an auxiliary, fictitious surface, which is usually defined conformally to the actual antenna outer structure. MMAS has been specifically developed for analyzing flat, thin, or open surfaces, and hence demonstrates an inherent capability for solving electromagnetic problems, involving curved wire antennas. In all cases, MMAS numerical simulations yield very good agreement with reference results. The major merit of the proposed method is its ability to easily produce very accurate results with relatively low computational cost, as shown by the complexity comparisons with the method of moments, performed in the paper.",

The mean and standard deviation of the detail subimages produced for each decomposition scheme were used as texture features. Feature selection included ranking the features in terms of their divergence values. The selected features were subsequently input to a classifier using support vector machines. Both transforms produced an 82.5% overall classification performance (75% and 85% for systole and 90% and 80% for diastole for DRT and FDCT, respectively). Those preliminary results in a somewhat limited sample population showed that, in terms of classification accuracy of ultrasound images of the carotid artery, ridgelet and curvelet \u2026",

Based on the hypothesis that asynchronous plaque motion is associated with vulnerable plaque, in this study, synchronisation patterns of different tissue areas were estimated using cross-correlations of displacement waveforms. In 135 plaques (77 subjects), plaque radial deformation was synchronised by approximately 50% with the arterial diameter, and the mean phase shift was 0.4 s. Within the plaque, the mean phase shifts between the displacements of the top and bottom surfaces were 0.2 s and 0.3 s, in the radial and longitudinal directions, respectively, and the synchronisation about 80% in both directions.

Several methods have been proposed for the estimation of the fractal dimension of an image. One of the most popular is via its power spectrum density, provided that it is modelled as fractional Brownian function. In this paper, a new method, called the Power Differentiation Method (PDM), for estimating the fractal dimension of a two variable signal from its power spectrum density is presented. The method is firstly applied to noise-free data of known fractal dimension. It is also tested to noise corrupted. Particularly, in the case of noise corrupted data, the Modified Power Differentiation Method (MPDM) is developed, resulting in more accurate estimation of the fractal dimension. The results obtained by the PDM and the MPDM are compared directly to those using four other well-known methods \u2026",

Simulations are performed within MedRadio band, which is worldwide available, and has been allocated exclusively for medical applications. The results highlight the suitability of the proposed simplified model for antenna fine-tuning.

Four variations are suggested, as determined by the tissue models used in each of the two steps of the design. The four variations differ in terms of the accuracy achieved in the resonance characteristics of the final antenna and the simulation time required for the design, given a specific medical application scenario.

Initially, we assess the radiation performance of implantable antennas for medical telemetry at 403.5 MHz, as a function size. Twenty circular implantable antennas of different radii are designed based on a parametric model, and further compared in terms of the exhibited radiation efficiency and far-field gain. Results indicate significantly improved radiation performance with size increase. Therefore, a novel algorithm is proposed, which applies Quasi-Newton optimization to optimize the design of the parametric antenna model under consideration, in order to achieve the best balance between size and exhibited radiation performance.",

Following the periodic movement of the heart and the resulting blood pressure variations during the cardiac cycle, the vascular wall performs a complex three-dimensional motion. Wall motion can be quantified through the calculation of a number of kinematic parameters, including displacements, velocities, and accelerations, as well as strain, which has gained attention for characterising tissue function. To estimate vascular motion from images, different imaging modalities can be used, including ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Among these, ultrasound imaging is the most widely used technique for vascular motion estimation, due to its wide availability, easy use, high temporal resolution, and possibility to access various central and peripheral vessels \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we present a framework implemented within the EU project MOSAIC, funded under the FP7 framework, to gather Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients' data coming from three European hospitals and a local health care agency. A subset of the MOSAIC activities is centered on the development of Temporal Data Mining models to identify relevant clinical pathways in patients' histories and will in particular benefit from the data coming from the medical centers involved in the project. To best exploit this repository, the need for creating a common and sharable data model becomes immediately apparent. This model is the main subject of this paper. The proposed approach relies on the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) open source software tools. It provides an integrated research setting to merge clinical and environmental \u2026",

The main advantage of the SSS algorithm is its relatively good accuracy at small computational time. The aim of the current work is to validate our implementation and to investigate the influence of several parameters. The validation tests are based on the NEMA\u2013NU 2001 standard about scatter accuracy. The results are compared both with data from the SimSET Monte Carlo (MC) simulation package and with measured data. The flexibility of our code can help us to understand the influence of many parameters of the algorithm, such that optimal values can be found for given time constraints, as for example the detector sampling and the voxel size of the transmission image.",

The validation of motion analysis algorithms remains, however, a challenging task mainly because the actual tissue motion field is not readily available. In this paper, a methodology is suggested for the generation of simulated dynamic B-mode ultrasound image data of the common carotid artery. The approach consists of three main stages: (a) the generation of a scattering map using a real ultrasound image as a template, (b) the assumption of a mathematical model of arterial wall deformation in the radial and axial directions and (c) the generation of simulated sequential data by displacing the scattering map according to the deformation model. The procedure is based on the use of FIELD II, an ultrasound simulation package \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Advances in the field of closed-loop neuromodulation call for analysis and modeling approaches capable of confronting challenges related to the complex neuronal response to stimulation and the presence of strong internal and measurement noise in neural recordings. Here we elaborate on the algorithmic aspects of a noise-resistant closed-loop subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation system for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, ensuring remarkable performance in terms of both efficiency and selectivity of stimulation, as well as in terms of computational speed. First, we propose an efficient method drawn from dynamical systems theory, for the reliable assessment of significant nonlinear coupling between beta and high-frequency subthalamic neuronal activity, as a biomarker for feedback control. Further, we present a model-based strategy through which optimal parameters of stimulation for minimum energy desynchronizing control of neuronal activity are being identified. The strategy integrates stochastic modeling and derivative-free optimization of neural dynamics based on quadratic modeling. On the basis of numerical simulations, we demonstrate the potential of the presented modeling approach to identify, at a relatively low computational cost, stimulation settings potentially associated with a significantly higher degree of efficiency and selectivity compared with stimulation settings determined post-operatively. Our data reinforce the hypothesis that model-based control strategies are crucial for the design of novel stimulation protocols at the backstage of clinical applications.",

The model takes as input patient's information regarding meal intake, glucose measurements, and insulin infusion rates, and provides glucose predictions. The predictions are fed to the NMPC, in order for the latter to estimate the optimum insulin infusion rates.

            "Abstract": "Breast parenchymal density has been found to be a strong indicator for breast cancer risk but the process of classification by the radiologists has been proved to be quite subjective. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the effectiveness of most modern CAD systems used for breast abnormality detection diminishes greatly when parenchymal breast tissue density is high. Therefore the existence of a system to provide automatically accurate and objective estimation of the parenchymal breast density category is of great importance. In the present work we present a method to perform breast density classification based on local textural characteristics of the image, known as textons. We make the assumption that the mammographic image comprises a \u201cdocument\u201d with a number of \u201cvisual words\u201d and the \u201cdocument\u201d \u201ctopic\u201d is the wanted density category.

We sought to investigate the horizontally-oriented multiresolution textural properties of arterial wall and plaque in a carefully selected sample of asymptomatic male subjects.

            "Abstract": "Several models, with various degrees of complexity have been proposed to model the neuronal activity from different parts of the human brain. We have shown before that various modeling approaches, including a Hammerstein\u2013Wiener (H\u2013W) model, can be used to predict the spike trains from a deep nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, using the underlying local field potentials. In this article, we present, in depth, the various choices one has to make, and the limitations that they introduce, during the H\u2013W model parameter identification process. From a segment of the recorded data, which contains information about the spike times of a single neuron, we identify and extract the model parameters. We then use those parameters to numerically simulate the spike timing, the rhythm and the inter-spike intervals for the rest of the recording. To assess how well the model fits to the measured data we combine measures of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Motion of the carotid artery wall can be quantitatively estimated from sequences of B-mode ultrasound images. Ultrasound scanner settings, including dynamic range and persistence, can affect the appearance of anatomical structures, and consequently, the results of motion analysis. In this paper, the effects of dynamic range and persistence were studied, in an attempt to suggest optimal values for reliable motion analysis. Image sequences were recorded using four different values for dynamic range, namely 0, 48, 66 and 90 dB, and three different values for persistence, namely 0, 5.6 and 50. Radial and axial displacements as well as the correlation coefficients were estimated using block-matching from recordings of about 3 sec duration. The variances of radial and axial displacements were not significantly affected by changes in dynamic range and persistence. The mean value of the correlation coefficient, which is an index of the reliability of motion analysis, was also not significantly affected by these settings. However, an increase in persistence increased the delays between peak radial displacements and cardiac systole. It is suggested that high values of dynamic range (66 or 90 dB) and low values of persistence (0 or 5.6) are used for motion analysis based on block-matching.",

The Lippmann-Schwinger Scattering Integral Equation (SIE), used to describe the associated inverse scattering problem, is discretized using a spectral domain moment technique, where the unknown internal field is expanded in a limited number of plane waves while the scatterer is expressed in terms of Gaussian basis functions. The inverse scattering problem is formulated as a problem of non-linear optimization that is solved using either the modified gradient method or the quasi-Newton method. Numerical results indicate that the quasi-Newton method provides faster convergence and better accuracy for the given inverse scattering problem formulation.",

The propagation of each spectral component of the incident field within the tissue medium is analyzed by applying an integral-equation technique and a Fourier-series representation is used in order to obtain the time dependence of the electromagnetic fields produced at any point within tissue due to the pulsed excitation of the array elements.

            "Abstract": "Block matching (BM) has been previously used to estimate motion of the carotid artery from B-mode ultrasound image sequences. In this paper, Kalman filtering (KF) was incorporated in this conventional method in two distinct scenarios:(a) as an adaptive strategy, by renewing the reference block and (b) by renewing the displacements estimated by BM or adaptive BM. All methods resulting from combinations of BM and KF with the two scenarios were evaluated on synthetic image sequences by computing the warping index, defined as the mean squared error between the real and estimated displacements. Adaptive BM, followed by an update through the second scenario at the end of tracking, ABM_KF-K2, minimized the warping index and yielded average displacement error reductions of 24% with respect to BM. The same method decreased estimation bias and jitter over varying center frequencies by 30% and 64 \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Breast microcalcifications are one of the most important mammographic findings related to the existence of the breast cancer. Radiologists usually characterize microcalcifications based on their morphologies, the distribution within the cluster they form, the shape of the cluster and its relative location inside the breast. In this study, we focus on the latter factor and we study its effect on the probability of malignancy. The main purpose of our study is to generate probabilistic breast cancer atlases for clusters of microcalcifications in order to visualize the influence of cluster location on cancer probability. We propose a framework for the generation of such atlases, including segmentation of important breast landmarks and projection of different clusters of microcalcifications on a reference breast shape. The generation of the atlases is implemented using mammograms from the Digital Database of Screening Mammography \u2026",

To this end, it introduced a novel computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) scheme, which relies on the analysis of ultrasound videos to stratify patient risk. Based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), it is guided by spatiotemporal patterns representing motion and strain activity in the arterial wall and it acts as a voice-recognition analogue. The designed CAD scheme was optimized and evaluated on a dataset of 96 high-and low-risk patients with CA, by investigating patterns with the strongest discrimination power and the optimal HMM parameterization. It was concluded that the optimized CAD scheme provides a CAD response with accuracy between 76% and 79%. The introduced CAD scheme may serve as a valuable tool in the routine clinical practice for CA toward personalized and valid therapeutic decision for the disease.",

Such systems base their diagnosis on image features extracted from mammograms, which are mainly related to the shape, the morphology, the texture and the position of the suspicious abnormality. Since the discrimination of malignant and benign lesions is a classification problem, a feature selection preprocessing step is needed in order to minimize the dimensionality of the features set by keeping the most significant between them. In this paper, we compare four feature selection methods all based on different approaches on ranking and selection and perform classification of data.

These algorithms can be used efficiently to solve the inverse scattering problem for weak scatterers in the frequency domain under the first-order Born and Rytov approximations. Previous attempts of 3-D reconstruction with plane-wave illumination have used data obtained with the incident direction restricted at the xy plane. However, we show that this restriction results in the omission of the contribution of certain spatial frequencies near the \u03c9_z axis for the final reconstruction. The effect of this omission is studied by comparing the results of reconstruction with and without data obtained from other incident directions that fill the spatial frequency domain \u2026",

Mainly motivated by increasing health care costs, there has been a trend toward facilitating out-of-hospital patient monitoring using wearable and wireless technology (Tr\u00f6ster, 2005; Akay et al., 2012; Istepanain and Zhang, 2012). By employing on-body sensors that record physiological signals of a user such as the electrocardiogram, the body temperature, the oxygen saturation, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the respiration rate, wearable health monitoring systems (WHMS) can provide real-time updates about a user\u2019s physiological status. Data are usually communicated to some type of network managing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a custom microcontroller board, which can in turn preprocess and then transmit the captured measurements to a remote station or hospital via a wireless network such as WiFi and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). As a result, these data can be made available to a remote supervising location in real time.",

The feature extraction level calculates the average grey scale and 48 texture characteristics, which are derived from the spatial grey-level co-occurrence matrices, obtained from the ROI's. The classifier level consists of three sequentially placed feed-forward Neural Networks (NN's), which are activated sequentially. The first NN classifies into normal or pathological liver regions.

In this paper we study several statistical measures that have been proposed for identifying the nature of the involved activations. All these measures are based on some mean of an appropriate signal attribute over trials in the time/ frequency domain and do not characterize the variability across trials. In order to quantify trial-to-trial variability we consider a measure based on entropy, characterizing the distribution of power across trials. The results indicate that brain activations can be characterized and differentiated by their behavior from trial to trial.",

We have shown before that there is an input-output relationship between these two components in the STN. In the present paper, we extend these observations by using LFP-driven Volterra models and the Laguerre expansion technique to estimate nonlinear dynamic models which are able to predict the recorded spiking activity. To this end, we rigorously examine the optimal model order. The improved performance of the second-order Volterra models indicates that there is a nonlinear relationship between the LFP and the spiking activity. To \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The design of each new hospital site is typically preceded by decisions on the most appropriate level of biomedical equipment which significantly influences the layout of the hospital departments which are under construction. The most appropriate biomedical equipment should ideally be decided upon considering a series of demographic and social parameters of the hospital and international regulations and standards. This information should ultimately be distilled to proper technical specifications. This paper proposes a streamlined management process related to the procurement of biomedical equipment for new hospital sites or for those under expansion. The new management process aims to increase the efficiency of the experts involved in the definition of the most appropriate level of equipment and its technical specifications. It also addresses all aspects of the biomedical equipment-selection cycle, including \u2026",

In some cases, confirmation of the diagnosis is particularly difficult because it requires specialization and experience, or even the application of interventional methodologies (e.g. arteriography). While advances in medical imaging technology have greatly contributed to early detection and diagnosis of vascular disease, the selection of patients to whom surgery is offered remains one of the most challenging tasks in the management of vascular disease.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a scale/frequency approach, based on the wavelet transform, was used in an attempt to characterize carotid atherosclerotic plaque from B-mode ultrasound. Two wavelet decomposition schemes, namely the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet packets (WP), and three basis functions, namely Haar, symlet3 and biorthogonal3.1, were investigated in terms of their ability to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A total of 12 detail sub-images were extracted using the DWT and 255 using the WP decomposition schemes. It was shown that WP analysis by the use of Haar filter and the l-1 norm as texture descriptor could reveal differences not only in high but also in low frequencies, and therefore characterize efficiently the atheromatous tissue. Additional studies applying and further extending the above methodology are required to ensure the usefulness of wavelet-based \u2026",

The validation tests are based on the NEMA-NU 2001 standard about scatter accuracy. The results of our implementation are compared both with data from the SimSET Monte Carlo simulation package and with measured data. The flexibility of our code can help us to understand the influence of many parameters of the algorithm, such that optimal values can be found for given time constraints, as for example are the detector sampling and the voxel size of the transmission image.

Automatic systems that support patients to count the nutrient contents, like carbohydrates (CHO), of their meals, can provide valuable tools. In this study, a food recognition system is proposed, which consists of two modules performing feature extraction and classification of food images, respectively. The dataset used consists of 1200 food images split into six categories (bread, meat, potatoes, rice, pasta and vegetables). Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) along with Color and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features are extracted from the food images. The Bag-Of-Features (BOF) model is used in order to reduce the features space. A modified version of the All-And-One Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed to perform the task of classification and its performance is evaluated against several classifiers that follow the SVM or the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) approach. The proposed classification method has achieved the highest levels of accuracy (Acc= 94.2%) in comparison with all the other classifiers.",

The on-body repeater antenna favors the use of very low power IMDs. The on-body repeater receives low power data from an IMD (MedRadio band, 401-406 MHz) and retransmits it to remote devices placed further apart (ISM band, 2400-2480 MHz ). The MedRadio implantable antenna maintains miniature size (399 mm 3 ), and exhibits two close resonances which increase the -10 dB bandwidth inside muscle tissue (87 MHz). The on-body antenna is relatively small (6720 mm 3 ), and exhibits dual resonances in the MedRadio and ISM bands. Assuming a typical arm implantation scenario and an on-body \u2026",

In this paper, we attempted a small study on the use and performance of three variations of block matching, namely forward-, backward- and combination-block-matching, in terms of estimating arterial wall motion. Simulated ultrasound image sequences, generated using (a) FIELD-II, an ultrasound simulation package and (b) a mathematical model of arterial wall displacement, were used. The warping index, defined as the mean geometric error in pixels between the true and recovered deformation, was used to evaluate the performance of the block matching techniques \u2026",

In a group of 5 mild OSAS subjects, with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) <;10, and 20 severe OSAS subjects, with AHI>;10, approximate and sample entropy, but not Shannon entropy, produced significantly higher values in the severe OSAS group.

Standard protocols could be optimized by regulating the administered activity A (adm) such that the statistical quality is maximized for each individual patient for a given scan time. The objective is to model the direct relationship between the noise equivalent count rate NECR and A (adm) for a wide range of scanner and patient parametersemployed in clinical scans.Methods: A series of extensive and validated Monte Carlo simulations is utilized to systematically investigate, under realistic and controlled conditions, the effect of a wide set of (i) phantom sizes modeling children, slim and obese patients,(ii) bed positions,(iii) energy windows,(iv) coincidence time windows,(v) and combination of dead times and detector A (adm).Results: A wide plateau is observed in NECR A (adm) curves particularly for large patients, admsuggesting that 90-95% of peak NECR can still be obtained with considerably less A (adm) Moreover, for default scanner configurations and cardiac beds, an optimal A (adm) range of 55-65MBq for HR+ and 300-450 MBq for Biograph scanners, with the maximum NECR beingconsiderably higher for the latter.Conclusions: The generalized NECR A (adm) model can be utilized to predict for each individual patient scan an optimal range of A (adm) for which NECR is maximized, thus potentially allowing (a) for efficient utilization of the available activity in PET centers and (b) for minimization of cumulative radiation exposure.",

Carotid plaques obtained from 78 consecutive patients (40 symptomatic [SG], 38 asymptomatic [AG]) undergoing CEA were histologically analyzed for galectin-3, macrophages (CD68) and laminin. Pre-operatively the biochemical profile and plaque echogenicity (gray-scale median, GSM) score were determined.There were no significant differences in clinical and demographic parameters between SG and AG (p > .05).

In our previous work, these data have been analysed using artificial neural network methods, which identified optimised subsets of factors to predict one's obesity status. These methods did not reveal though how the selected factors interact with each other in the obtained predictive models. For that reason, parallel Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (pMDR) was used here to further analyse the pre-selected subsets of nutrigenetic factors. Within pMDR, predictive models using up to eight factors were constructed, further reducing the input dimensionality, while rules describing the interactive effects of the selected factors were derived.

We demonstrate that non-regular patterns of stimulation displaying a minimum variability of 70-80% yield a significantly higher Lyapunov exponent compared with regular stimulation, at the 5% significance level. The stochastic model points to the prominent role of nonregular stimulation patterns in the therapeutic outcome of deep brain stimulation (DBS).",

For each plaque, a vector of texture and motion features was estimated, which was then reduced to the most robust ones by means of ANalysis of VAriance (ANOVA).

The DTF method reveals causal information flows between brain areas, while direct DTF (dDTF) is able to distinguish and estimate only direct flows. Since neuro-physiological signals such as EEG and event related potentials (ERP) can be nonstationary, their temporal dynamics cannot be satisfactorily represented. Time-varying dDTF can be estimated using Kalman Filter for adaptive calculation of multivariate autoregressive coefficients. This approach can reveal transient causal relations and model time-dependent flow patterns. This approach was applied to simulated signals and the results indicated that time-varying dDTF can provide efficient estimates of connectivity patterns.",

The first one refers to the in vitro development and radiation response of a tumor spheroid whereas the second one refers to the fractionated radiation response of a clinical tumor in vivo based on the patient's imaging data. In each case, a description of the salient points of the corresponding algorithms and the visualization techniques used takes place. Specific applications of the models to experimental and clinical cases are described and the behavior of the models is two- and three-dimensionally visualized by using virtual \u2026",

Regions of Interest (ROI's) corresponding to normal liver, cyst, hemangioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, are drawn by an experienced radiologist on abdominal nonenhanced CT images. For each ROI, five distinct sets of texture features are extracted using the following methods: first order statistics, spatial gray level dependence matrix, gray level difference method, Laws' texture energy measures, and fractal dimension measurements. If the dimensionality of a feature set is greater than a predefined threshold, feature selection based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied. Classification of the ROI is then carried out by a system of five neural networks (NNs), each using as input one of the above feature sets. The members of the NN system (primary classifiers \u2026",

Currently, a great effort is made both in Medicine and Neurosciences for understanding and modeling in details how the STN cells work. The aim of this work is the development of a phenomenological model of an STN neuron that receives the local field potentials as its input and outputs a spike train. The model is physiologically inspired by the temporal summation observed in neurons. After estimating the model's numerical parameters and stochastic properties by fitting the available intranuclear data, we show that the model can predict with reasonable accuracy single spikes as well as the presence of bursts by following closely the \u2026",

The results reveal that in LOS cases the radar is exposed to severe IB, and possible OOB interference, from an LTE transmitter being 8.4 km apart. This could create serious complications in the design, and deployment procedure of an LTE network, unless robust mitigation techniques are considered. Finally, in NLOS conditions, no harmful interference is detected.",

Considering that the ability of a motion estimator (ME) to handle changes in the appearance of motion targets has a major effect on accuracy in MA, we investigated the potential of adaptive block matching (ABM) MEs, which consider changes in image intensities over time. To assure the validity in MA, we optimized and evaluated the ABM MEs in the context of a specially designed in silico framework.

Almost 30 years after the start of the modern era of deep brain stimulation (DBS), the subthalamic nucleus (STN) still constitutes a standard stimulation target for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), but the use of STN-DBS is also now supported by level I clinical evidence for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Disruption of neural synchronization in the STN has been suggested as one of the possible mechanisms of action of standard and alternative patterns of STN-DBS at a local level. Meanwhile, recent experimental and computational modeling evidence has signified the efficiency of alternative patterns of stimulation; however, no indications exist for treatment-refractory OCD.

The statistical quality of the projection data increases when longer acquisition times are selected. However, very large scanning periods can limit the number of PET studies performed and, moreover, increase the probability of motion artifacts. The competing objectives of good statistical quality and short acquisition time are both depending on the counting rate performance of the system. The noise equivalent count rate (NECR), which measures the rate in which statistically important coincidence events are counted by a PET system, is employed in this study to quantify the counting-rate performance. Thus, higher NECR values allow for acquisition of relatively larger number of true coincidence counts at the same scanning time. NECR is directly depending, for a particular patient-scanner \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of intraoperative hyperthermia (IOHT) in the management of stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Twenty-seven patients (group A) received pre-operative chemotherapy (5-FU), by-pass surgery with intraoperative bolus infusion of 5-FU and post-operatively multi-agent chemotherapy plus sandostatin and external beam irradiation (45Gy, 25 fractions, 5 days a week). In a non-randomized way, 10 patients (group B) received an additional single session of IOHT (43-45\u00b0C, 1h) performed directly on the tumour using a waveguide applicator (433MHz) with interstitial measurements of temperature measured. A brief instrument was developed for evaluating patients' quality of life. No progressive disease (PD) was noticed in group B vs 11% (3/27) of PD in group A. There was also a significant increase of overall survival (OS) in group B vs A patients ( p = 0.029, log-rank \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the characterization of hepatic tissue from computed tomography (CT) images is presented. Regions of interest (ROI's) corresponding to four types of hepatic tissue are drawn by an experienced radiologist on abdominal non-enhanced CT images. For each ROI, five sets of texture features are extracted and combined to provide input to the CAD system. If the dimensionality of a feature set is greater than a predefined threshold, appropriate feature selection based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied. Classification of the ROI is then carried out using an ensemble of classifiers consisting of two neural network (NN) and three statistical classifiers. The final decision of the CAD system is based on the application of a voting scheme across the outputs of the primary classifiers of the ensemble. A classification performance of the order of 90.63% was finally achieved.",

            "Abstract": "Biomedical telemetry permits the transmission (telemetering) of physiological signals at a distance. One of its latest developments is in the field of implantable medical devices (IMDs). Patch antennas currently are receiving significant scientific interest for integration into the implantable medical devices and radio-frequency (RF)-enabled biotelemetry, because of their high flexibility in design, conformability, and shape. The design of implantable patch antennas has gained considerable attention for dealing with issues related to biocompatibility, miniaturization, patient safety, improved quality of communication with exterior monitoring/control equipment, and insensitivity to detuning. Numerical and experimental investigations for implantable patch antennas are also highly intriguing. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of these challenges, and discuss the ways in which they have been dealt with so far \u2026",

A technical pilot study has been carried out on clinical sites, monitoring the performance of the implementation, which revealed high interactivity during an on-line collaboration session.",

            "Abstract": "Fractal dimension (FD) is a natural measure of the irregularity of a curve. In this study the performances of three waveform FD estimation algorithms (ie Katz's, Higuchi's and the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm) were compared in terms of their ability to detect the onset of epileptic seizures in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). The selection of parameters involved in FD estimation, evaluation of the accuracy of the different algorithms and assessment of their robustness in the presence of noise were performed based on synthetic signals of known FD. When applied to scalp EEG data, Katz's and Higuchi's algorithms were found to be incapable of producing consistent changes of a single type (either a drop or an increase) during seizures. On the other hand, the k-NN algorithm produced a drop, starting close to the seizure onset, in most seizures of all patients. The k-NN algorithm outperformed both Katz's and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Biocompatibility is one of the most important aspects that need to be taken into account when it comes to implantable antennas. However, very few studies have addressed the effects that biocompatibility considerations might have on the design and performance of implantable antennas. This study addresses the conversion of non-biocompatible implantable antennas into their biocompatible equivalents, exploring the difficulties and proposing solutions. Two methods are suggested for ensuring the biocompatibility of implantable antennas, and these are further investigated and compared. The proposed biocompatible antennas are finally evaluated within an anatomical head model for intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitoring applications.",

The proposed interpolation technique is implemented using morphological operations and incorporates a distance function to improve the computational effectiveness of the technique. The morphological interpolation technique is compared to an existing shape based interpolation method and its advantages include superiority capability on handling various cases such as the branching and holes problem (appearance and disappearance of information) and more accurate volume estimation. Furthermore, the morphological technique is companied with a 3-D reconstruction algorithm capable of representing any anatomical structure from real 3-D medical data. Introducing a novel general rule, the algorithm triangulates all standard cube \u2026",
