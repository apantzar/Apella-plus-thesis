            "Abstract": "Privacy Preserving and Anonymity have gained significant concern from the big data perspective. We have the view that the forthcoming frameworks and theories will establish several solutions for privacy protection. The k-anonymity is considered a key solution that has been widely employed to prevent data re-identifcation and concerns us in the context of this work. Data modeling has also gained significant attention from the big data perspective. It is believed that the advancing distributed environments will provide users with several solutions for efficient spatio-temporal data management. GeoSpark will be utilized in the current work as it is a key solution that has been widely employed for spatial data. Specifically, it works on the top of Apache Spark, the main framework leveraged from the research community and organizations for big data transformation, processing and visualization. To this end, we focused on trajectory data representation so as to be applicable to the GeoSpark environment, and a GeoSpark-based approach is designed for the efficient management of real spatio-temporal data. Th next step is to gain deeper understanding of the data through the application of k nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries either using indexing methods or otherwise. The k-anonymity set computation, which is the main component for privacy preservation evaluation and the main issue of our previous works, is evaluated in the GeoSpark environment. More to the point, the focus here is on the time cost of k-anonymity set computation along with vulnerability measurement. The extracted results are presented into tables and figures for visual inspection. View \u2026",

One of their strongest features is elasticity, which allows for fairly portioned premiums and high-quality performance. Yet, the process of adaptive expansion and contraction of resources usually involves a lot of manual effort, often requiring the definition of the conditions for scaling up or down to be provided by the users. To date, there exists no open-source system for automatic resizing of NoSQL clusters. In this demonstration, we present TIRAMOLA, a modular, cloud-enabled framework for monitoring and adaptively resizing NoSQL clusters. Our system incorporates a decision-making module which allows for optimal cluster resize actions in order to maximize any quantifiable reward function provided together with life-long adaptation to workload or infrastructural changes.

The -tree compares favorably to other overlays for the following reasons: (a) it provides matching and better complexities, which are deterministic for the supported operations; (b) the management of nodes (peers) and elements are completely decoupled from each other; and (c) an efficient deterministic load-balancing mechanism is presented for the uniform distribution of elements into nodes, while at the same time probabilistic optimal bounds are provided for the congestion of operations at the nodes. The load-balancing scheme of elements into nodes is deterministic and general enough to be applied to other hierarchical tree-based overlays. This load-balancing mechanism is based on an innovative lazy weight-balancing mechanism, which is interesting in its own right.",

Our protocol assumes no trust on a third party and/or other peers, and it is specifically suited for low-min entropy data (i.e., data that can be exhaustively searched by an attacker), such as encrypted users locations. We demonstrate that our primitive is secure and efficient: Two public-key exponentiations are required, per each user, for each equality testing. We give implementation results, showing that our primitive is practical in a multiple users scenario. Finally, we describe how we could use our primitive as a building block for a proximity testing buddy-finder service for social networks.",

On this purpose and based on the efficient P2P method presented in [16], we design a novel P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a sensornet, the so-called ELDT (Energy Level Distributed Tree). Sensor nodes are mapped to peers based on their energy level. As the energy levels change, the sensor nodes would have to move from one peer to another and this oparation is the most crucial for the efficient scalability of the proposed system. Similarly, as the energy level of a sensor node becomes extremelly low, that node may want to forward it's task to another node with the desired energy level.

This work elaborates on the idea of extracting feature characteristics from time-based online content by means of users' interactions analysis instead of analyzing the content itself. Accordingly, a time series of users\u2019 activity in online media is constructed and shown to exhibit rich temporal dynamics. Additionally it is demonstrated that is also possible to detect characteristic patterns in collective activity while accessing time-based media. Pattern detection of collective activity, as well as feature extraction of the corresponding pattern, is achieved by means of a time series clustering approach. This is demonstrated with the proposed approach featuring information-rich videos. It is shown that the proposed probabilistic algorithm effectively detects distinct shapes of the users\u2019 time series, predicting correctly popularity dynamics, as well as their scale characteristics.",

A set of such predicates forms a buffer query or a Spatio-temporal Pattern (STP) Query with time. In the more general case of an STP query, the temporal dimension is introduced via the relative order of the spatial predicates (STP queries with order). Therefore, the efficient processing of a spatiotemporal predicate is crucial for the efficient implementation of more complex queries of practical interest. We propose an extension of a known approach, suitable for processing spatial predicates, which has been used for the efficient manipulation of STP queries with order. The extended method is supported by efficient indexing structures. We also provide experimental results that show the efficiency of the technique.",

Batch normalization is also considered since it acts as a regularizer and achieves the same accuracy with fewer training steps. For maximizing the yield of the complexity by diminishing, as well as minimizing the loss of accuracy, LSTM neural net layers are utilized in the process. The image sequences are proven to be classified by the LSTM in a more accelerated manner, while managing better precision. Concretely, the more complex the CNN, the higher the percentages of exactitude; in addition, but for the high-rank increase in accuracy, the time was significantly decreased, which eventually rendered the trade-off optimal.

Our first result is an improvement over the one of VS Subrahmanian [Subramanian, 1998] by a logarithmic factor in storage. This is achieved by using different basic data structures. Then, we present two other interesting time-efficient approaches.

In addition to the obvious musicological interest, different machine learning approaches and algorithms have been proposed for such a task, strengthening thus the challenge of efficient and effective music information utilization using probabilistic systems. Consequently, the aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the specific research domain as well as to shed light on the subtasks that have arisen and since evolved.

However, this approach in some cases seems not enough since the accumulation of data doesn't offer any kind of insight about them or for a possible combination of them.

This is useful, since the goal of energy efficiency at the household level can be achieved through energy-saving policies towards changing the behavior of the consumers. This requires as a prerequisite to be able to measure the energy consumption at the appliance level. The purpose of this study is to present some initial results towards this goal by making heavy use of the characteristics of a particular din-rail meter, which is provided by Meazon S.A. Our thinking is that meter-specific energy disaggregation solutions may yield better results than general-purpose methods, especially for sophisticated meters. This meter has a 50 Hz sampling rate over 3 different lines and provides a rather rich set of measurements with respect to the extracted features. In this paper we aim at evaluating the set of features generated by the smart meter. To this end, we use well-known supervised machine learning models and test their effectiveness on certain appliances when selecting specific subsets of features. Three algorithms are used for this purpose: the Decision Tree Classifier, the Random Forest Classifier, and the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier. Our experimental study shows that by using a specific set of features one can enhance the classification performance of these algorithms.",

On this purpose and based on the efficient P2P method presented in [16], we design a novel P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a sensornet, the so-called ELDT (Energy Level Distributed Tree). Sensor nodes are mapped to peers based on their energy level. As the energy levels change, the sensor nodes would have to move from one peer to another and this oparation is the most crucial for the efficient scalability of the proposed system. Similarly, as the energy level of a sensor node becomes extremelly low, that node may want to forward it's task to another node with the desired energy level.

An important direction, apart from the optimization of the description mechanism, is the availability of WS information in an accessible way for machine processing. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized approach for Web Service discovery based on a new P2P based approach. This novel approach enables efficient Web Services discovery. Peers that store Web Services information, such as data item descriptions, are efficiently located using a scalable and robust data indexing structure for Peer-to-Peer data networks, BDT-GRID (Balanced Distributed Tree). BDT-GRID provides support for processing (a) Exact match Queries of the form \u201cgiven a key, map the key onto a node\u201d and (b) Range Queries of the form \u201cmap the nodes whose keys belong to a given range\u201d. BDT-GRID adapts efficiently update queries as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from our theoretical analysis point out that the communication cost of the query and update operations scaling in rooted and double-logarithmic time complexity on the number of nodes respectively. Furthermore, our system is also robust on failures.",

Towards this orientation, early pathway-based approaches coupled expression data with whole pathway interaction topologies but it was the recent approaches that zoomed into subpathways (local areas of the entire biological pathway) that provided more targeted and context-specific candidate disease biomarkers. Here, we explore the application potential of PerSubs, a graph-based algorithm which identifies differentially activated disease-specific subpathways. PerSubs is applicable both for microarray and RNA-Seq data and utilizes the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database as reference for biological pathways. PerSubs operates in two stages: first, identifies differentially expressed genes (or uses any list of disease-related genes) and in second stage, treating each gene of the list as start point, it scans the pathway topology around to build meaningful subpathway topologies. Here, we apply PerSubs to investigate which pathways are perturbed towards mouse lung regeneration following H1N1 influenza infection. View Full-Text",

We present in brief the theoretical algorithmic analysis, in which our proposed structure is based on, and we describe thoroughly the key aspects of the implementation. Conducting experiments, we verify that the implemented structure outperforms other well-known hierarchical tree-based structures, since it provides better complexities regarding load-balancing operations. More specifically, the structure achieves a logarithmic amortized bound, using an efficient deterministic load-balancing mechanism, which is general enough to be applied to other hierarchical tree-based structures. Moreover, we investigate the structure's fault tolerance, which hasn't been sufficiently tackled in previous work, both theoretically and through rigorous experimentation. We prove that D3-Tree is highly fault tolerant, since, even for massive node failures, it achieves a significant success rate in element queries. Afterwards we go one step further, in order to achieve sub-logarithmic complexity and propose the ART+ structure (Autonomous Range Tree), exploiting the excellent performance of D3-Tree. ART+ is a fully dynamic and fault-tolerant structure, which achieves sub-logarithmic performance for query and update operations and performs load-balancing in sub-logarithmic amortized cost.",

            "Abstract": "In the context of this research work, we studied the problem of privacy preserving on spatiotemporal databases. In particular, we investigated the k-anonymity of mobile users based on real trajectory data. The k-anonymity set consists of the k nearest neighbors. We constructed a motion vector of the form (x, y, g, v) where x and y are the spatial coordinates, g is the angle direction, and v is the velocity of mobile users, and studied the problem in four-dimensional space. We followed two approaches. The former applied only k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm on the whole dataset, while the latter combined trajectory clustering, based on K-means, with k-NN. Actually, it applied k-NN inside a cluster of mobile users with similar motion pattern (g, v). We defined a metric, called vulnerability, that measures the rate at which k-NNs are varying. This metric varies from 1 k (high robustness) to 1 (low robustness) and represents the probability the real identity of a mobile user being discovered from a potential attacker. The aim of this work was to prove that, with high probability, the above rate tends to a number very close to 1 k in clustering method, which means that the k-anonymity is highly preserved. Through experiments on real spatial datasets, we evaluated the anonymity robustness, the so-called vulnerability, of the proposed method. View Full-Text",

We transform the surface\u2019s boundary poly-lines to dual points and we focus on the information distortion introduced by this space translation.

Ultimately, we need to turn to scalable solutions and methods using the NoSQL database model. Quite a few indexing methods exist in literature that work on top of NoSQL database.

Although a lot of effort has been invested in developing systems and mechanisms that enable elasticity, the elasticity decision policies tend to be designed without quantifying or guaranteeing the quality of their operation. We present an approach towards the development of more formalized and dependable elasticity policies. We make two distinct contributions. First, we propose an extensible approach to enforcing elasticity through the dynamic instantiation and online quantitative verification of Markov Decision Processes(MDP) using probabilistic model checking. Second, various concrete elasticity models and elasticity policies are studied.

            "Abstract": "The current work is focusing on the implementation of a robust watermarking algorithm for digital images, which is based on an innovative spread spectrum analysis algorithm for watermark embedding and on a content-based image retrieval technique for watermark detection. The highly robust watermark algorithms are applying \"detectable watermarks\" for which a detection mechanism checks if the watermark exists or no (a Boolean decision) based on a watermarking key. The problem is that the detection of a watermark in a digital image library containing thousands of images means that the watermark detection algorithm is necessary to apply all the keys to the digital images. This application is non-efficient for very large image databases. On the other hand \"readable\" watermarks may prove weaker but easier to detect as only the detection mechanism is required. The proposed watermarking algorithm combine's the advantages of both \"detectable\" and \"readable\" watermarks. The result is a fast and robust watermarking algorithm.",

However, contrary to structural rankings, functional ones are bound to be network-specific since each social platform offers unique interaction possibilities.

            "Abstract": "We present the interpolation search B-tree (ISB-tree), a new cache-aware indexing scheme that supports update operations (insertions and deletions) in O (1) worst-case block transfers and search operations in O (log B log n) expected block transfers, where B represents the disk block size and n denotes the number of stored elements. The expected search bound holds with high probability for a large class of (unknown) input distributions. The worst-case search bound of our indexing scheme is O (log B n) block transfers. Our update and expected search bounds constitute a considerable improvement over the O (log B n) worst-case block transfer bounds for search and update operations achieved by the B-tree and its numerous variants. This is also verified by an accompanying experimental study.",

Subpathway-based approaches are the emerging generation of pathway-based analysis elucidating the biological mechanisms under the perspective of local topologies onto a complex pathway network. Towards this orientation, we developed PerSub, a graph-based algorithm which detects subpathways perturbed by a complex disease. The perturbations are imprinted through differentially expressed and co-expressed subpathways as recorded by RNA-seq experiments. Our novel algorithm is applied on data obtained from a real experimental study and the identified subpathways provide biological evidence for the brain aging.",

In this context, decentralized approaches based on Peer to Peer overlay networks have been proposed by many researchers as a solution. In this paper, we propose a new structured P2P overlay network infrastructure designed for Web Services Discovery.

            "Abstract": "A -nearest neighbor (NN) query determines the  nearest points, using distance metrics, from a specific location. An all -nearest neighbor (ANN) query constitutes a variation of a NN query and retrieves the  nearest points for each point inside a database. Their main usage resonates in spatial databases and they consist the backbone of many location-based applications and not only (i.e. NN joins in databases, classification in data mining). So, it is very crucial to develop methods that answer them efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel method for classifying multidimensional data using an ANN algorithm in the MapReduce framework. Our approach exploits space decomposition techniques for processing the classification procedure in a parallel and distributed manner. To our knowledge, we are the first to study the classification of multidimensional objects under this perspective. Through an extensive experimental evaluation we prove that our solution is efficient and scalable in processing the given queries. We investigate many different perspectives that can affect the total computational cost, such as different dataset distributions, number of dimensions, growth of  value and granularity of space decomposition and prove that our system is efficient, robust and scalable.",

            "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. One of the system's key features, is the immediacy in communication with other users in an easy, user-friendly and fast way. Consequently, people tend to express their feelings freely, which makes Twitter an ideal source for accumulating a vast amount of opinions towards a wide diversity of topics. This amount of information offers huge potential and can be harnessed to receive the sentiment tendency towards these topics. However, since none can invest an infinite amount of time to read through these tweets, an automated decision making approach is necessary. Nevertheless, most existing solutions are limited in centralized environments only. Thus, they can only process at most a few thousand tweets. Such a sample, is not representative to define the sentiment polarity towards a topic due to the massive number of tweets published daily. In this paper, we go one step further and develop a novel method for sentiment learning in the MapReduce framework. Our algorithm exploits the hashtags and emoticons inside a tweet, as sentiment labels, and proceeds to a classification procedure of diverse sentiment types in a parallel and distributed manner. Moreover, we utilize Bloom filters to compact the storage size of intermediate data and boost the performance of our algorithm. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we prove that our solution is efficient, robust and scalable and confirm the quality of our sentiment identification.",

To accomplish this, we make a straightforward reduction of this problem to the intersection problem in Computational Geometry. Our result is an improvement over the one of VS Subrahmanian [10] by a logarithmic factor in storage and is achieved by using different basic data structures. This logarithmic save is of great importance in video databases because vast space is needed to store videos and metadata for each video. Finally, we present two time-efficient approaches.

In this paper we study the problem of canonical k-vertex polygon queries on the plane. A canonical k-vertex polygon query always meets the following specific property: a point retrieval query can be transformed into a linear number (with respect to the number of vertices) of point retrievals for orthogonal objects such as rectangles and triangles (throughout this work we call a triangle orthogonal iff two of its edges are axis-parallel).

            "Abstract": "Biomedicine is a pillar of the collective, scientific effort of human self-discovery, as well as a major source of humanistic data codified primarily in biomedical documents. Despite their rigid structure, maintaining and updating a considerably-sized collection of such documents is a task of overwhelming complexity mandating efficient information retrieval for the purpose of the integration of clustering schemes. The latter should work natively with inherently multidimensional data and higher order interdependencies. Additionally, past experience indicates that clustering should be semantically enhanced. Tensor algebra is the key to extending the current term-document model to more dimensions. In this article, an alternative keyword-term-document strategy, based on scientometric observations that keywords typically possess more expressive power than ordinary text terms, whose algorithmic cornerstones are third order tensors and MeSH ontological functions, is proposed. This strategy has been compared against a baseline using two different biomedical datasets, the TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) genomics benchmark and a large custom set of cognitive science articles from PubMed.

The parameter d represents the number of elements (distance) between the search element and an element pointed to by a pointer termed finger. Our data structure is based on a previous result by Fleischer that exhibits the same asymptotic time and space complexities for simple search trees. We improve on this result by handling deletions in an explicit way without using the standard trick of global rebuilding. This is the first search tree that combines worst-case update times with a local rebalancing scheme without using global rebuilding to tackle deletions.

The key innovation is that the solution is based on a totally new infrastructure, which is not vulnerable to classic disadvantages. We present a theoretical analysis backed up by experimental results, which shows that the communication cost of query and update operations scale sublogarithmically in the worst case with the number of NBDT nodes, outperforming three of the most popular decentralised infrastructures: Chord (and some of its successors), BATON (and its successor) and Skip Graphs.

We have utilized WebML as the design platform of our approach and we capture design reuse by detecting all the recurrent design structures within the hypertext schema of an application. We propose a methodology for automatically extracting the hypertext schema of an application which is then submitted to a pattern-based analysis in order to detect all the incorporated recurrent patterns implying design reuse. A pattern is a design structure consisting of a core specification, i.e., an invariant composition of WebML elements that characterizes the pattern and by a number of pattern variants which extend the core specification with all the valid modalities in which the pattern composition can start (starting variants) or terminate (termination variants \u2026",

Accordingly, it is proposed that the aggregated users' video activity exhibits characteristic patterns. Such patterns may be used in order to infer important video scenes leading thus to collective intelligence concerning the video content. To this end, experimentation is based on users' interactions (e.g., pause, seek/scrub) that have been gathered in a controlled user experiment with information-rich videos. Collective information seeking behavior is then modeled by means of the corresponding probability distribution function. Thus, it is argued that the bell-shaped reference patterns are shown to significantly correlate with predefined scenes of interest for each video, as annotated by the users.

One such task is assigning sentiment polarity labels to the vertices of a large social network based on local ground truth state vectors containing structural, functional, and affective attributes. Emotions have been long identified as key factors in the overall social network resiliency and determining such labels robustly would be a major indicator of it.

Quantum General Variable Neighborhood Search (qGVNS) is a novel, quantum inspired extension of the conventional GVNS. Its quantum nature derives from the fact that it takes advantage and incorporates tools and techniques from the field of quantum computation. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known NP-Hard problem which has broadly been used for modelling many real life routing cases. As a consequence, TSP can be used as a basis for modelling and finding routes for Geographical Systems (GPS). In this paper, we examine the potential use of this method for the GPS system of garbage trucks. Specifically, we provide a thorough presentation of our method accompanied with extensive computational results. The experimental data accumulated on a plethora of symmetric TSP instances (symmetric in order to faithfully simulate GPS problems), which are shown in a series of figures and tables, allow us to conclude that the novel qGVNS algorithm can provide an efficient solution for this type of geographical problems.",

Subsequently, our model analyzes these data in order to classify customers as well as products, being trained and validated with real data. This model is targeted towards classifying customers according to their consuming behaviour and consequently proposes new products more likely to be purchased by them. The corresponding prediction model is intended to be utilized as a tool for marketers so as to provide an analytically targeted and specified consumer behavior. Our algorithmic framework and the subsequent implementation employ the cloud infrastructure and use the MapReduce Programming Environment, a model for processing large data-sets in a parallel manner with a distributed algorithm on computer clusters, as well as Apache Spark, which is a newer framework built on the same principles as Hadoop. Through a MapReduce model application on each step of the proposed method, text processing speed and scalability are enhanced in reference to other traditional methods.

To present the capabilities of the solution, we deliver the concept of K-anonymity to protect mobile users that issue queries to location-based services. Experimental evaluation of the solution includes development of real-life logging dataset using smartphones by volunteers.

In this context, assuming that a sensor is responsible for executing some program task but unfortunately it's energy-level is lower than a pre-defined threshold. Then, this sensor should be able to introduce a query to the whole system in order to discover efficiently another sensor with the desired energy level, in which the task overhead must be eventually forwarded. In this way, the \"Life-Expectancy\" of the whole network could be increased. Sensor nodes are mapped to peers based on their energy level. As the energy levels change, the sensor nodes would have to move from one peer to another and this operation is very crucial for the efficient scalability of the proposed system. Similarly, as the energy level of a sensor node becomes extremely low, that node may want to forward it's task \u2026",

            "Abstract": "General variable neighborhood search (GVNS) is a well known and widely used metaheuristic for efficiently solving many NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. We propose a novel extension of the conventional GVNS. Our approach incorporates ideas and techniques from the field of quantum computation during the shaking phase. The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well known NP-hard problem which has broadly been used for modelling many real life routing cases. As a consequence, TSP can be used as a basis for modelling and finding routes via the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we examine the potential use of this method for the GPS system of garbage trucks. Specifically, we provide a thorough presentation of our method accompanied with extensive computational results. The experimental data accumulated on a plethora of TSP instances, which are shown in a series of figures and tables, allow us to conclude that the novel GVNS algorithm can provide an efficient solution for this type of geographical problem.

One such query is the All k Nearest-Neighbor Query, or k Nearest-Neighbor Join, that takes as input two datasets and, for each object of the first one, returns the k nearest-neighbors from the second one. It is a combination of the k nearest-neighbor and join queries and is computationally demanding. Especially, when the datasets involved fall in the category of Big Data, a single machine cannot efficiently process it. Only in the last few years, papers proposing solutions for distributed computing environments have appeared in the literature. In this paper, we focus on parallel and distributed algorithms using the Apache Hadoop framework.

Moreover, the cognitive map is segmentwise continuous and preserves many of the major topological features of the latter. Therefore, neurons, trained using a Hebbian learning rule, can approximate the shape of any arbitrary manifold provided there are enough neurons to accomplish this. Moreover, the cognitive map can be readily used for clustering and visualization. Because of the above properties, SOMs are often used in big data pipelines. This conference paper focuses on a multilinear distance metric for the input vector space which adds flexibility in two ways. First, clustering can be extended to higher order data \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The polygon retrieval problem on points is the problem of preprocessing a set of  points on the plane, so that given a polygon query, the subset of points lying inside it can be reported efficiently. It is of great interest in areas such as Computer Graphics, CAD applications, Spatial Databases and GIS developing tasks. In this paper we study the problem of canonical -vertex polygon queries on the plane. A canonical -vertex polygon query always meets the following specific property: a point retrieval query can be transformed into a linear number (with respect to the number of vertices) of point retrievals for orthogonal objects such as rectangles and triangles (throughout this work we call a triangle orthogonal iff two of its edges are axis-parallel). We present two new algorithms for this problem. The first one requires  space and  query time. A simple modification scheme on first algorithm lead us to a second solution, which consumes  space and  query time, where  denotes the size of the answer and  is the number of vertices. The best previous solution for the general polygon retrieval problem uses  space and answers a query in  time, where  is the number of vertices. It is also very complicated and difficult to be implemented in a standard imperative programming language such as C or C++.",

In particular, the trajectory of a mobile user in a plane is no longer a polyline in a two-dimensional space, instead it is a two-dimensional surface of fixed width , where  defines the semi-diameter of the minimum spatial circular extent that must replace the real location of the mobile user on the XY-plane, in the anonymized (kNN) request. The desired anonymity is not achieved and the entire system becomes vulnerable to attackers, since a malicious attacker can observe that during the time, many of the neighbors' ids change, except for a small number of users. Thus, we reinforce the privacy model by clustering the mobile users according to their motion patterns in (u, ) plane, where u and  define the velocity measure and the motion direction (angle) respectively. In this case, the anonymized (kNN) request looks up neighbors, who belong to the same cluster with the mobile requester in (u, ) space: Thus, we know that the trajectory of the k-anonymous mobile user is within this surface, but we do not know exactly where. We transform the surface's boundary poly-lines to dual points and we focus on the information distortion introduced by this space translation. We develop a set of efficient spatiotemporal access methods and we experimentally measure the impact of information distortion by comparing the performance results of the same spatiotemporal range queries executed on the original database and on the anonymized one.",

Service migration is incorporated in the Chord P2P system, imposing certain changes (e.g., the extension of the service discovery scheme of Chord) and introducing an extra system overhead (i.e., update messages) for the efficient operation of the (enhanced) system. As it is demonstrated here using simulation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Multimodal social networks are omnipresent in Web 2.0 with virtually every human communication action taking place there. Nonetheless, language remains by far the main premise such communicative acts unfold upon. Thus, it is statutory to discover language communities especially in social data stemming from historically multilingual countries such as Luxemburg. An adjacency tensor is especially suitable for representing such spatiosocial data. However, because of its potentially large size, heuristics should be developed for locating community structure efficiently. Linguistic structure discovery has a plethora of applications including digital marketing and online political campaigns, especially in case of prolonged and intense cross-linguistic contact.

Besides the need for a rich description mechanism, Web service information should be made available in an accessible way for machine processing. In this paper, we propose a new P2P based approach for Web services discovery. Peers that store Web services information, such as data item descriptions, are efficiently located using a scalable and robust data indexing structure for peer-to-peer data networks, NIPPERS. We present a theoretical analysis which shows that the communication cost of the query and update operations scale double-logarithmically with the number of NIPPERS nodes. Furthermore, we show that the network is robust with respect to failures fulfilling quality of Web services requirements.",

            "Abstract": "The need to store massive volumes of spatio-temporal data has become a difficult task as GPS capabilities and wireless communication technologies have become prevalent to modern mobile devices. As a result, massive trajectory data are produced, incurring expensive costs for storage, transmission, as well as query processing. A number of algorithms for compressing trajectory data have been proposed in order to overcome these difficulties. These algorithms try to reduce the size of trajectory data, while preserving the quality of the information. In the context of this research work, we focus on both the privacy preservation and storage problem of spatio-temporal databases. To alleviate this issue, we propose an efficient framework for trajectories representation, entitled DUST (DUal-based Spatio-temporal Trajectory), by which a raw trajectory is split into a number of linear sub-trajectories which are subjected to dual transformation that formulates the representatives of each linear component of initial trajectory; thus, the compressed trajectory achieves compression ratio equal to M: 1. To our knowledge, we are the first to study and address k-NN queries on nonlinear moving object trajectories that are represented in dual dimensional space. Additionally, the proposed approach is expected to reinforce the privacy protection of such data. Specifically, even in case that an intruder has access to the dual points of trajectory data and try to reproduce the native points that fit a specific component of the initial trajectory, the identity of the mobile object will remain secure with high probability. In this way, the privacy of the k-anonymity method is reinforced \u2026",

The expected search bound holds with high probability for any (unknown) realistic input distribution. Our expected search bound constitutes an improvement over the O(log B  logn) expected bound for search achieved by the ISB-tree (Interpolation Search B-tree), since the latter holds with high probability for the class of smooth only input distributions. We define any unknown distribution as realistic if the smoothness doesn\u2019t appear in the whole data set, still it may appear locally in small spatial neighborhoods.

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing has become the leading paradigm for deploying large-scale infrastructures and running big data applications, due to its capacity of achieving economies of scale. In this work, we focus on one of the most prominent advantages of cloud computing, namely the on-demand resource provisioning, which is commonly referred to as elasticity. Although a lot of effort has been invested in developing systems and mechanisms that enable elasticity, the elasticity decision policies tend to be designed without guaranteeing or quantifying the quality of their operation. This work aims to make the development of elasticity policies more formalized and dependable. We make two distinct contributions. First, we propose an extensible approach to enforcing elasticity through the dynamic instantiation and online quantitative verification of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) using probabilistic model checking. Second, we propose concrete elasticity models and related elasticity policies. We evaluate our decision policies using both real and synthetic datasets in clusters of NoSQL databases. According to the experimental results, our approach improves upon the state-of-the-art in significantly increasing user-defined utility values and decreasing user-defined threshold violations.",
