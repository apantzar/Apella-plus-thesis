A new class of classification problems, called \u2018scalable\u2019is introduced that models many problems from the area of Web mining. The property of scalability is defined as the ability of a classifier to adjust classification results on a \u2018per-user\u2019basis. Furthermore, we investigate on different ways to interpret personalization of classification results by analyzing well known text datasets and exploring existent classifiers. We present solutions for the scalable classification problem based on standard classification techniques and present an algorithm that relies on the semantic analysis using document decomposition into its sentences. Experimental results concerning the scalability property and the performance of these algorithms are provided using the 20newsgroup dataset and a dataset consisting of web news.",

We describe the Bandwidth Broker architecture that was our model for the simulation implementation. Furthermore, we illustrate the experiments that we conducted that examined the Bandwidth Broker functionality as well as its performance. All the experiments demonstrated that with this implementation we can achieve end-to-end QoS and that our implementation can be used in order to model the behavior of a Bandwidth Broker in the widely popular NS-2 network simulator.",

In addition, the expansive use of small screen devices for browsing the World Wide Web generates huge problems when trying to find and read information. A solution to these problems is to personalize the web and try to reduce algorithmically the amount of text. Many text summarizers have been presented in order to reduce the valueless information that is presented to the users and many web sites, especially news portals, introduce personalization features for the users, though, still these techniques are not often used in combination in order to create more effective results. In this paper a mechanism for creating personalized summaries for the members of a news portal that reproduces articles collected from major portals is presented, together with evaluation both of the summarizer and the personalized summaries. The evaluators of the personalized summaries are members of the news portal. The personalized summary mechanism can also be utilized by users of small screen devices, for easier reading of less but inclusive information.",

The LIBS spectra of these olive oil samples were used to train different machine learning algorithms, namely LDA, ERTC, RFC, XGBoost, and to assess their classification performance. In addition, the variable importance of the spectral features was calculated, for the identification of the most important ones for the classification performance and to reduce their number for the algorithmic training.

The proposed mechanism consists of a priority-scheduling algorithm, at the network layer, and the use of the IEEE 802.11e standard at the MAC layer. The priority-scheduling algorithm takes into account the frame type of the MPEG-4 video file in order to provide different priorities to the most important video packets. At the MAC layer, the IEEE 802.11e protocol assigns the highest priority to video applications to reduce delay and packets losses due to other competing traffic.

The need for improved road safety, traffic efficiency and direct communication along with the great complexity in routing, makes VANETs a highly challenging field. Routing in VANETs has to adapt to special characteristics such as high speed and road pattern movement as well as high linkage break probability. In this work, the authors show that traditional MANET routing protocols cannot efficiently handle the challenges in a VANET environment and thus need further modifications. For this reason, they propose and implement an enhancement mechanism, applied to the GPSR routing protocol that adapts to the needs of a VANET.

In this paper we present how it supports real-time IP multimedia services, as these services are expected to drive the adoption of wireless all-IP networks. The scheme of real time streaming video is one of the newcomers in wireless data communication and in particular in UMTS, raising a number of novel requirements in both telecommunication and data communication systems. This scheme applies when the mobile user is experiencing real time multimedia content. In this paper, we describe the design and the implementation of a decision feedback scheme, which is based on real time protocols and it is used for streaming video over UMTS transport channels. The decision feedback scheme uses a friendly, to the mobile users, congestion control mechanism to control the transmission rate of the real time video sequence. Furthermore \u2026",

Power control is one of the most important aspects in MBMS due to the fact that Node B's transmission power is a limited resource and must be shared among all MBMS users in a cell. Consequently, the analysis of transmitted power plays a fundamental role in the planning and optimization process of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) radio access networks. This paper investigates several factors affecting Node B's transmission power levels such as, cell deployment, propagation models, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, users' distributions and mobility issues.

One limiting factor that influences LTE performance is the interference from neighbouring cells, the so called Inter-Cell Interference (ICI). The investigation of ICI mitigation techniques has become a key focus area in achieving dense spectrum reuse in next generation cellular systems. Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) has been proposed as a technique to overcome this problem, since it can efficiently utilize the available frequency spectrum. This manuscript proposes a dynamic mechanism that selects the optimal FFR scheme based on a custom metric, which is called user satisfaction. In detail, the proposed mechanism divides the cell into two regions, the inner and outer region, and selects the optimal size as well as the optimal frequency allocation between these regions with main target to maximize the user satisfaction metric. The proposed mechanism is evaluated through several simulation scenarios that incorporate users\u2019 mobility and its selected FFR scheme is compared with other frequency reuse schemes in order to highlight its performance.",

Nowadays, femtocells can support multicast transmissions, while their hybrid operation allows non-subscribed users to use a portion of their resources. In this paper we propose a novel mechanism that is based on the selection of the appropriate Modulation and Coding Scheme. The mechanism allows non-subscribed users to utilize a portion of the femtocells' resources for multicast transmissions when located inside their coverage, without affecting the owners' satisfaction.

Through extensive experiments we proved that the summarization procedure can affect the categorization mechanism and vice versa. This means that when the results of the summarization mechanism seem to be weak, then the categorization can be used in order to provide a more efficient summary and on the other hand when the categorization procedure becomes too overloaded, the summarized articles can be used in order to categorize the article more efficiently. Moreover this paper introduces that the combination of summarization and categorization can lead to more efficient results not only for both mechanisms but for a personalized portal also.

This calls for a complete redesign of the architecture, services and service capabilities of the new infrastructures, and a re-thinking of interfaces, access and non-access protocols and related procedures, functions, and advanced algorithms, for authorization, authentication, establishment, maintenance and reconfiguration of ICT services and any type of resource among cyber-physical entities, especially at the edge. Several challenges need to be addressed to meet and exceed the expected key performance indicators, in terms of throughput (1000x more in aggregate and 10x more at link level), service-level latency (1ms for tactile Internet and below 5ms for 2-8K change in view, at 30-50Mb/s), energy efficiency (90% less consumption for the same service compared to 2010 levels), coverage (global and seamless experience), battery lifetime (10x longer), QoS, manageability, etc. Moreover, the advanced 5G infrastructure needs to be highly flexible in order to meet foreseen as well as unknown requirements, in alignment with current and future stakeholders\u2019 expectations, while optimising the total cost of ownership in \u2026",

Due to the constant motion of wireless devices, infrastructure wireless networks cannot provide connectivity at all times, in comparison with ad hoc networks, which are more easy to use and are based on abstract and continuously altering topologies. The use of specialized routing protocols is improving the performance of these networks, concluding to lower power consumption and faster communication. However, routing is not enough to preserve the battery power of the mobile devices. By using a power control mechanism on top of the routing protocols, further power savings can be achieved.

Both emission and absorption spectra were initially preprocessed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and were subsequently used for the construction of predictive models, employing Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). All data analysis methodologies were validated by both \u201ck-fold\u201d cross-validation and external validation methods. In all cases, very high classification accuracies were found, up to 100%.

The TMRL is useful for the temporary record of information from the path from the mobile users to the GGSN. Additionally, a Multicast Group List (MGL) is kept in the GGSN which records the members of each multicast group. These lists lead to the decrement of the transmitted packets and the more efficient use of the network resources in the multicast routing in UMTS.

This requires up\u2010to\u2010date (on\u2010line) information feed on the situation, including voice and video from the affected zone. However, MANETs do not seem to efficiently support multimedia applications, and this is quite evident in video transmission. One way to remedy this is to use more (wireless) interfaces per mobile node and consequently more communication channels. In this work, we perform an analytical study on the use of multiple interfaces and multiple \u2026",

After the activation of QoS service in GRNET, a new need for automation of mechanisms for QoS in Videoconferencing session arises. The traditional QoS workflow inserts important administrative cost when a connected institute wants to have a videoconference service with specific QoS guaranties. In such case, the network administrator must manual configure the network\u2019s edge routers. In order to overcome the above limitation, an \u201cautomatic\u201d procedure for providing QoS guaranties to videoconference session was investigated. The result was an automatic solution that provides QoS using the QoS Policy Propagation via BGP mechanism for signaling. This automatic QoS deployment solution was tested successfully on the network and some performance measurement are presented in this paper.",

The key attributes of ASSP are: (a) TCP-friendly behavior, (b) adaptive per-stream transmission rates, (c) adaptive scalability to large sets of receivers and (d) smooth transmission rates that are suitable for multimedia applications. We evaluate the performance of ASSP under an integrated simulation environment which combines the measurements of both network and video performance metrics.

Our design provides priority to video packets and exploits information from the MAC layer in order to improve TFRC\u2019s performance. The proposed cross-layer design utilizes SNR measurements along the routing path, in order to make the route reconstruction procedure more efficient.

A crawler has to be efficient and polite, trying not to harm or overload the pages it is visiting. Therefore, it is extremely important to follow specific rules when crawling. In addition to these rules, the mechanism we created includes a selective incremental algorithm, which is used to make the crawler more efficient and more polite in parallel. The structure and design of the mechanism is simple, but the experimental results showed us that this simplicity makes our crawler a very strong and stable mechanism.",

Since the users at the inner region are less exposed to inter-cell interference, the frequency resources in each inner region can be universally used. Based on this frequency band allocation, FFR may reduce channel interference and offer large system capacity. This paper proposes a mechanism that selects the optimal FFR scheme based on the user throughput and user satisfaction. In detail, the mechanism selects the optimal size of the inner and outer region for each cell as well as the optimal frequency allocation between these regions that either maximizes the mean user throughput or the user satisfaction. The mechanism is evaluated through several simulation scenarios.",

The information that exists on the World Wide Web is huge enough in order to distract the users when trying to find useful information. In order to overcome the large amounts of data many methodologies of text categorization have been presented. One major problem we have to deal with is that many articles fetched by a crawler, then stored in a back-end database, and finally given as an input to a categorization subsystem, may not contain valid information for the user (trashy articles). This may lead to the user losing his trust towards the system. In this paper, we analyze the special properties of trashy news articles\u2019 categorization that allows us to detect them and we propose a specific methodology for trash detection.

SLAs for QoS-enabled networks move one step forward in the direction of traditional ones, in the sense that they do not only have to specify availability, security, quantity of allocated resources and a number of other quantitative values but also have to specify the values of appropriate quality parameters. This paper deals with the particular cases of introduction of QoS mechanisms to large transport networks according to the DiffServ architecture. In these cases, the extensive level of aggregation of flows and the connectionless nature of QoS services\u2019 provisioning makes the definition of QoS parameters and the engineering of QoS metrics in the traditional SLA specification a demanding task. Due to the fact that strictly bounded deterministic guarantees are not realistic, usually only upper bounds for the relevant parameters can be defined and the corresponding SLAs have to be defined accordingly.",

Furthermore, for the first time, the emission spectra of LIBS were fused with the absorption spectra to create predictive models and their accuracies were found to be significantly improved.

            "Abstract": "When it comes to 3D Virtual Environments it is well known that 3D sound is of great importance to the whole interactive experience. The percept of sound is a major counterpart for the eyesight, since it describes the location, the momentum and the attitude towards the listener, of each surrounding entity. The sound can offer precision of spatial perception that cannot be achieved by the eye itself. Thus the support of 3D surround sound of high fidelity is mandatory for a 3D Virtual platform. The evolution of Internet telephony led to the introduction of new session establishment and management protocols. The most important of them, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), is a robust, lightweight reliable and fast application-layer control (signaling) protocol that is highly adopted for creating, modifying and terminating sessions. This protocol can be of extreme importance in establishing audio sessions for multi-user platforms. This paper presents the work done for developing a SIP 3D spatial audio server for a multi-user virtual environments platform, called EVE, in order to support 3D spatial audio.",

Multicasting is an efficient method of supporting group communication as it allows the transmission of packets to multiple destinations using fewer network resources. The need for broadcasting and multicasting in UMTS led to the definition of the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) framework, which targets to the efficient utilization of radio and network resources of the UMTS network. This chapter introduces the key concepts of UMTS and in particular the MBMS framework of UMTS. Moreover, it investigates the power profiles of several transport channels (common, dedicated and shared) which could be employed for the transmission of MBMS services to the mobile users. Problems regarding the high power requirements, for the realization of MBMS are also presented in this chapter.

We compared this technique with the single minded bag-of-words representation that our clustering algorithm, W-kmeans, previously used.

In this paper we study the interference mitigation techniques in femtocell/macrocell networks and we propose a frequency reuse mechanism that leads to increased overall system performance. In particular, the mechanism aims to maximize throughput via a variety of combinations between inner cell radius and frequency allocation to the macrocell. Additionally, a position minded frequency allocation to the femtocells targets to further optimize the total throughput of the cell.",

There are two major issues that have to be considered when designing and implementing such a service, the fairness and the adaptation schemes. The fairness problem results from the fact that receivers with different capabilities have to be served. In our application we use a mechanism that categorizes the receivers into a number of groups according to each receiver\u2019s capabilities and (the mechanism) serves each group of users with a different multicast stream. With the term \u201ccapabilities\u201d we do not only mean the processing power of the client, but also the capacity and the condition of the network path towards that client. Because of today\u2019s Internet heterogeneity and the lack of Quality of Service (QoS) support, the sender cannot assume that the receivers will permanently be able to handle a specific bit rate. We have therefore implemented an additional mechanism for the intra-stream bit rate adaptation.",

Routing in VANETs has to adapt to special characteristics such as high speed and road pattern movement as well as high linkage break probability. In this paper, we propose an enhancement mechanism for the GPSR routing protocol and present its performance for urban and highway scenarios. Its performance is compared to the performance of the most common MANET routing protocols adopted in VANETs.

The critical requirements for devices connected to the IoT are long battery life, long coverage, and low deployment cost. Some applications require the transmission of data over long distances, thus Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) have emerged, with LoRa being one of the most popular players of the market. In order, to improve energy consumption and connectivity problems, machine learning can be used in LoRa networks. In this paper, we intend to improve the energy consumption of end nodes by using machine learning models. For this reason, we present a comparison of classification algorithms, specifically, the k-NN, the Na\u00efve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for the Spreading Factor (SF) assignment in LoRa networks. The simulation results indicate that, both energy \u2026",

Femtocells are a type of Base Station that is expected to dominate, due to their low cost and easy deployment and maintenance. However, trying to increase spectral efficiency with the use of femtocells, by multiple base stations utilizing the same spectrum will lead to severe interference phenomena.

To this direction, we have designed and implemented a framework that simulates femtocell overlays integrated over LTE-A macrocellular systems.

It proposes a novel mechanism that utilizes cross-layer approaches for adaptation of the power transmission level of the sender and feedback information regarding the wireless connection status from the receiver for improved transmission statistics and therefore user experience without unnecessary power consumption. The mechanism is tested through simulations using ns2. Compared to the operation of the video transmission without the mechanism, we observe that it has benefits in terms of video quality.",

Such schemes inevitably add a constant overhead in the transmitted data. However, they are so simple as to meet a prime objective for UMTS multicast services, that is scalability to applications with thousands of receivers. This is the reason that 3GPP recommends the use of FEC for MBMS framework. In this paper, we use a probabilistic model for the multicast user distribution in the network and we define a scheme for multicast data delivery that combines FEC with traditional ARQ. It is important that our analysis is compliant with the 3GPP specifications and considers the latest advances in mobile networks. In this framework we investigate the impact of FEC use, we examine whether it is beneficial, how the optimal FEC code dimensioning varies based on the network conditions, which parameters \u2026",

FEC is a feedback free error recovery method where the sender introduces redundant data in advance with the source data enabling the recipients to recover from different arbitrary packet losses. The main issue on the efficient application of AL-FEC protection is the adaptation of the introduced redundancy to the current network conditions, in order to avoid network resources wastage ensuring at the same time sufficient transmission robustness.

            "Abstract": "We present in this paper a simulation-based comparison of two single-rate multicast congestion control schemes (TFMCC and PGMCC) against our proposed adaptive smooth multicast protocol (ASMP). ASMP consists of a single-rate multicast congestion control, which takes advantage of RTCP sender (SR) and receiver reports (RR). The innovation in ASMP lays in the \"smooth\" transmission rate, which is TCP-friendly and prevent oscillations. The smooth behavior is naturally well suited to multimedia applications as high oscillations of the sending rate may create distortions of audio-video (AV) encoders and decoders. Simulation results, which are conducted with the network simulator ns2 software, showed that ASMP can be regarded as a serious competitor of TFMCC and PGMCC. In many cases, ASMP outperforms TFMCC in terms of TCP-friendliness and smooth transmission rates, while PGMCC presents lower \u2026",

MBMS is a key framework that constitutes a significant step towards the so-called Mobile Broadband by efficiently utilizing network and radio resources, both in the core network and more importantly, in the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN). One of most important problems that MBMS is currently facing is the assignment of the appropriate transport channel for the transmission of MBMS data. This paper proposes an alternative solution to the problem of efficient transport channel selection. In particular, we introduce a costbased scheme for the efficient radio bearer selection that minimizes the delivery cost of the multicast data. In our approach, the telecommunication cost over the most crucial interfaces of UMTS is calculated and based on this cost, the appropriate radio bearer is selected.",

As far as outdoor navigation is consider, the Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is still one of the most (if not the most) commonly used approaches. Even though it is still considered an ideal solution for navigating in outdoor areas, challenges and problems arise when GPS is considered for navigation inside buildings due to obstacles (eg, shopping malls, hospitals, etc.) and because signals cannot be absorbed by the building walls. To tackle the aforementioned issue, other technologies have emerged aimed at indoor navigation, such as Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth and sensors. This paper\u2019s contribution is towards indoor navigation and more specifically, it targets at designing and developing a tracking and navigation system aimed at people that experience difficulties in indoor orientation using a wearable device. The user takes direction from the wearable device for the indoor orientation through voice commands helping him to avoid obstacles. The central part of the system is a device that provides the ability to navigate and route by voice commands, based on the device's location and orientation capabilities.",

Currently, the majority of mobile applications are native applications that need an initial installation prior to being utilized. In addition, for a given application, a separate software development process could be required for each mobile platform, which subsequently increases dramatically the corresponding effort and cost. With the emergence of HTML5 these issues can be addressed efficiently, since web technologies allow the application development in a cross-platform manner. An important benefit is that users can have easy and immediate access the application without any need for downloading and installation. In this manuscript, we investigate the potentials of mobile application development with web technologies and we present a development framework that we have designed and implemented. This framework utilizes the most important state-of-art web technologies for the support of mobile devices.

To support multimedia broadcast/multicast services (MBMS), long term evolution offers the functionality to transmit MBMS over a single frequency network, where a time\u2010synchronized common waveform is transmitted from multiple cells for a given duration. This enables over\u2010the\u2010air combining, thus significantly improving the spectral efficiency (SE) compared with conventional MBMS operations.

This is accomplished through a web-based platform (MAES_GR) exclusively developed under the relevant, nation-wide LIFE-IP 4 NATURA project. Based on the European Commission\u2019s guidance for ecosystem condition (EC) and ecosystem services (ES) MAES studies, we conceptualized and structured an online platform to support EC and ES assessments, integrating all relevant fields of information needed for registering EC and ES parameters. A novel algorithm calculating EC was also developed and it is available as an integral part of the platform. The use of the MAES_GR platform was evaluated during nationwide field surveys efforts, increasing time efficiency and reducing costs. Field recording of EC and ES pinpoint spatial priorities for ecosystem restoration, conservation and sustainable development. This work highlights that MAES implementation can be favored by the use of technology tools such as mobile survey platforms, developed according to scientific needs and policy guidelines. Such tools, apart from the data inventory phase, can be used for data analysis, synthesis and extraction, providing timely, standardized information suitable for reporting at the local, regional, national and European Union scale.

Target of the proposed schema is (a) smooth transmission rate, in order to minimize the audio-video (AV) encoding and decoding distortion and (b) TCP friendly transmission. The \"smoothness\" lays in the way the TCP-friendly transmission rate is filtered. We integrate the congestion control functions in the RTP protocol and use the RTCP sender and receiver reports to provide the necessary feedback information for the sender's adaptive transmission rate. The performance evaluation of the smooth adaptation and TCP-friendliness is conducted through a number of simulations with the network simulator software (ns2). Our intention is to use this congestion control in the context of a proposed framework for multimedia transmission over wired and wireless networks.",

We evaluate SRAMT-S through a number of simulations in order to examine its behaviour to a heterogeneous group of receivers and its behaviour against TCP connections.

The CASTWATER online tool was designed to so as to provide two different functionalities. On the one hand, SMEs can self-evaluate their performance in sustainable water management and efficiently acknowledge possible actions that promote water efficiency in their tourism establishments. On the other hand, the tool measures, at both regional and local level, the levels of good governance and the effectiveness of water-tourism policies in order to improve sustainable water management. The approach presented in this work is heavily based on the initial technical specifications and end-user feedback, aiding SMEs in understanding, comparing, assessing and rating their performance regarding water efficiency and sustainable water management.",

One limiting factor that influences LTE performance is the interference from neighbor cells, the so called Inter-Cell Interference (ICI). Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) has been proposed as a technique to overcome this problem, since it can efficiently utilize the available frequency spectrum. This paper analyzes the FFR scheme and proposes a dynamic FFR mechanism that selects the optimal frequency allocation based on the cell total throughput and user satisfaction.

One of the key issues and problems that need to be handled in the design of a scalable and effective distributed virtual environment system is the partitioning problem, which refers to the efficient assignment of the system's workload to the available resources of the system. This paper presents an object driven partitioning approach based on the partitioning algorithm of Lui & Chan, who proposed a three step technique for balancing the workload among the servers of the Distributed Virtual Environment.",

It thus adds a compatibility layer across the different modules as it a common set of classes for the wireless modules. The system can be used to support the networking aspects of a variety of IoT applications, including applications for Smart Cities, using a variety of IoT devices.

High penetration is expected in the upcoming ultra dense 5G networks, increasing the probability of femtocells' clusters.

In this paper we present a mechanism where multiple femtocells coordinate their transmission to serve multiple non-subscribed users through hybrid access. First, the spectrum allocation of non-subscribed users by femtocells is determined. Then, we introduce a power control algorithm that is based on two factors. The need for compensation for the subscribed users, due to reduced spectrum, and the effect that any change in power transmission will have on neighbouring femtocells.

In the case of backbone networks the DiffServ architecture has prevailed, due to its scalability and deployment feasibility. The provisioning of differentiated services has raised the requirements for interdependent controlled resource allocation and service pricing, with particular needs for pricing mechanisms that preserve the potential and flexibility of the DiffServ framework. At the same time, such mechanisms should reflect resource usage, allocate resources efficiently, reimburse costs or maximize service provision profits and lead customers to requesting services that will maximize their revenue.

Services like videoconferencing or distance learning are demanding features that load the network nodes and consume a large portion of the throughput provided by the network [1]. The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) constitutes the most prevalent standard of the 3G cellular networks. Despite the high capacity that UMTS networks provide, the expected demand will certainly overcome the available resources. This is the reason why multicast transmission is one of the major goals for UMTS and 3G networks in general. Multicast is an efficient method for data transmission to multiple destinations. Its advantage is that the sender\u2019s data is transmitted only once \u2026",

To this direction the use of forward error correction (FEC) on the application layer is widely adopted in several mobile multicast standards. FEC is a feedback free error control method where the transmitter introduces in advance redundant information to enable receivers recovering data erasures. On multicast delivery and especially on the time constrained streaming delivery where retransmission-based error recovery methods are not feasible, the most suitable error control method is the use of application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) codes.

            "Abstract": "Proposals to handle differentiated and guaranteed services in Internet have not provided the benefits that users and operators are expecting. Its complexity, with a large number of interconnected networks, is difficult to handle in an efficient way. This is due to the resource heterogeneity in terms of technologies and the inconsistent implementation of quality of services (QoS) in different networks. Despite several research activities in the area of QoS, Internet is still basically a best-effort network, which it is likely to stay, also in the far future. Streaming-based servers utilizing UDP for the underlying transport need to use some form of congestion control [1] to ensure the stability of Internet as well as the fairness to other flows, like those using TCP. The TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) is such a congestion control scheme appropriate for UDP. In this paper we target the question of how to optimize network and user-perceived performance in a best-effort network. In particular, we focus on the impact of end-to-end performance of the queue management scheme utilized in a wireless network.The first of the basic assumptions in this study is that the wireless last hop constitutes the bottleneck of the end-to-end (E2E) path. TFRC is intended for applications such as streaming media, where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance. TFRC measures loss rate by estimating the loss event ratio [2], and uses this measured rate to determine the sending rate in packets per RTT. When a bottleneck is shared with large-packet TCP flows, this has consequences for the rate achievable by TFRC. In particular a low bandwidth small-packet TFRC flow, sharing a \u2026",

For supporting large-scale DVEs, extended infrastructure is needed in terms of both hardware and software. However, both researchers and application designers do not always have access to such extended infrastructure and the assessment and evaluation of developed techniques becomes extremely difficult.

            "Abstract": "Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) are two key technologies that constitute a significant step towards the Mobile Broadband. MBMS was introduced by the third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in order to support broadcast and multicast communication over wireless networks and in particular over Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). Concurrently, HSDPA aims to ensure the transmission of high peak data rates and increase system capacity. In this paper we evaluate the performance of MBMS multicast transmission over the premier transport channel used in HSDPA, named High Speed-Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH). Due to the fact that downlink transmission power is the scarcest resource in UMTS networks, the evaluation is performed through an analytical dimensioning of the MBMS downlink transmission power \u2026",

            "Abstract": "News portals based on the RSS protocol are becoming nowadays one of the dominant ways that Internet users follow in order to locate the information they are looking for. Search engines, which operate at the back-end of a big portion of these web sites, receive millions of queries per day on any and every walk of web life. While these queries are submitted by thousands of unrelated users, studies have shown that small sets of popular queries account for a significant fraction of the query stream. A second truth has to do with the high frequency that a particular user tends to submit the same or highly relative search requests to the engine. By combining these facts, in this paper, we design and analyze the caching algorithm deployed in our personalized RSS portal, a web-based mechanism for the retrieval, processing and presentation in a personalized view of articles and RSS feeds collected from major Internet news portals. By using moderate amounts of memory and little computational overhead, we achieve to cache query results in the server, both for personalized and non-personalized user searches. Our caching algorithm operates not in a stand-alone manner but it co-operates and binds with the rest of the modules of our Portal in order to accomplish maximum integration with the system.",

While as of now this technique has been proven adequate in homogeneous networks where all BSs have similar transmission levels, in increasingly dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets) rate is heavily dependent on the load, which can significantly vary from BS to BS. The introduction of new devices in HetNets, with increased demands in the UL direction, makes the former approach obsolete and poses a threat to the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by the network. Decoupling Uplink and Downlink is the proposed solution, where the UL cell association is not necessarily based on the same criteria as the DL association.

            "Abstract": "Telecommunication base stations (TBSs), which are the basis of the telecommunications network, consume more energy than other public buildings due to their high inner heat density and special operating schedule. The number of mobile phone users in China exceeds 500 million, and the telecommunications network has become the largest in the world, consisting of more than 100,000 TBSs. The annual energy consumption of the network is 20 billion kWh, one third of which is used by TBSs. Guangzhou, as one of the fastest developing cities in China, has more than one thousand existing TBSs and the total annual electricity bills are in the tens of millions of RMB, 25% of which is the cost of air conditioning. With the rapid growth of telecommunications, energy conservation for TBSs is gaining greater attention in China.Previous studies on energy conservation in TBSs mainly focused on improvement of efficient air-conditioning systems (Nakao et al., 1988; Maeda et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2007), indoor airflow optimization (Hayama & Nakao, 1989; Dan & Matti, 2000), use of renewable energy (Makhkamdjanov, 2006), and other energy saving and monitoring techniques (Schmidt & Shaukatullah, 2003). There are very limited studies on building energy efficiency design of TBS. Building energy efficiency design, which is known as passive cooling technology, is very popular in the traditional buildings and well inherited and applied in the modern buildings in Southern China. Compared with the active one, such as airconditioning, passive cooling technology has notable advantages on utilizing natural cooling capacities with no or few energy \u2026",

Its\u2019 main advantage over traditional analogue TV is that it offers the viewers the ability to use their TV system in order to view or search for information in a way that is impossible with analogue TV. The next important step is the offer of interactivity with Service Providers, exchanging information, with the use of a return channel. Modern Set-Top-Boxes are not just decoders of the transmitted digital signals, but can be programmed to execute complex applications that can interact with the user through the use of the remote control and with Service Providers using a built-in modem and the PSTN network. Applications can be downloaded from satellite, loaded and executed dynamically, multiplexed with video and audio streams, along with the data needed, while a viewer changes the channel he/she watches. Using these types of applications the viewer becomes a user, using the provided services, despite of passively watching TV channels. In this paper, we describe an Interactive Digital TV platform being developed for delivering statistical and interactive services to the public. In particular, we use it for offering statistical data and an interactive game in which the users of the platform can compete by answering questions and making predictions.",

However, the added functionality often creates resource overhead both in the system as well as in the network host, which results in performance reduction. This paper presents such a networked virtual environment and based on the system's architecture tries to trace down with the time and recourse consuming parameters and proposes models on which a networked virtual environment, like the one presented, could achieve optimization of its performance.",

Such an increase calls for establishing new methods to manage these devices as well as utilize the data produced by them to establish network architectures that can prevent cellular networks from overloading. To achieve the desired results, we need to optimally allocate network resources to existing users. Resource allocation has traditionally been considered an optimization problem where proposed solutions are hard to implement in real time, resulting in the use of inferior solutions with reduced produced performance. With the introduction of Machine Learning, we propose three mechanisms, intending to utilize network data to improve real time network performance.

Therefore, in 5G, there is a need to push the envelope of performance to provide, where needed, for example, much greater throughput, much lower latency, ultra-high reliability, much higher connectivity density, and higher mobility range. A crucial point in the effective provisioning of 5G Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) lies in the efficient error control and in more details in the utilization of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes on the application layer. FEC is a method for error control of data transmission adopted in several mobile multicast standards. FEC is a feedback free error recovery method where the sender introduces redundant data in advance with the source data enabling the recipient to recover from different arbitrary packet losses.

            "Abstract": "The self-discharge phenomenon caused by side reactions such as corrosion, water decomposition and recombination is unavoidable in lead acid batteries. Self-discharge rates depend on several factors such as the state of charge, the temperature, grid alloys, etc. These rates are not equal between negative and positive electrodes and are independent of each other. In lead-acid batteries with antimony, the self-discharge rate of the negative electrode is several times stronger than the self-discharge rate of the positive electrode, depending mainly on the battery age and the antimony content in the alloy of the positive grid. In order to compensate for the self-discharge of lead-acid batteries, a current whose value exceeds the self-discharge of the negative electrode has to be supplied. This is traditionally achieved by applying a constant voltage whose value is slightly higher than the battery open circuit voltage. This is called \u201cfloat charge\u201d. It has to be kept in mind that the float polarization increases gas evolution rates at both electrodes. In antimony-free lead-acid batteries, eg VRLA batteries, the self-discharge rate of the negative electrode is largely reduced and usually becomes lower than the self-discharge rate of the positive electrode. The question is: are traditional float charges really suited to antimony-free lead-acid batteries? Practical situations on field as well as experimental results say no. Standby VRLA batteries maintained under a constant float voltage to compensate self-discharge encounter the problem of short service life, when our results show that traditional float charge currents are far over what is needed to maintain the VRLA battery \u2026",

In this paper, we provide a performance comparison of the standardized Raptor Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) scheme with the very promising RaptorQ FEC code. We examine the enhancements that RaptorQ introduces on the AL-FEC protection robustness, providing a thorough performance analysis in comparison \u2026",

The proposed mechanism is based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and assigns the node's SF value based on prior transmission data. This paper examines three different approaches for the selection of the SF during LoRa transmissions a) Random SF assignment b) Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and c) ML based SF selection. The main target is to study and determine the most efficient approach, as well as to investigate the exploitation of ML techniques in the context of LoRa networks. We created a simple library based on ML libraries, such as Scikit Learn that can be used with the FLoRa an OMNeT++ based LoRa simulator. With the use of this library, it is possible to predict the node's SF using ML techniques. Two classification algorithms were tested, the k Nearest Neighbors (k-NN \u2026",

In order to provide end-to-end QoS guarantees in these networks, the need for Layer 2 QoS deployment as well as the cooperation between any existing Layer 3 QoS deployment must be studied. QoS provisioning in Layer 2 is very important to networks that are primarily based on Layer 2 infrastructure as it is the only way to provide QoS on the network. Furthermore, networks based on both Layer 2 and Layer 3 network devices could benefit from a more integrated approach in end-to-end QoS provisioning that includes both Layer 2 and Layer 3.In today\u2019s broadband networks, congestion does not necessarily occur at the edge of the network (the link interconnecting the subscriber to the network core): congestion is equally likely to occur at the edge and in the core of the network. A common congestion cause of in broadband networks is the capacity mismatch in different parts of the network core. This calls for protection measures at the network perimeter and unified or interoperable QoS schema across all network (both layer 2 and layer 3).",

Edge computing is a new collaborative technology under standardization utilizing end-user devices or near-end-user edge devices to operate processing, communication, or control operations. The achievement of efficient error control is a very critical aspect in the successful development of 5G Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN). Especially utilizing Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes on the application level is an efficient approach on improving error control on NGMN since it is adopted in several mobile multicast standards. FEC is a feedback free error control technique where redundant data are introduced with the source data to enable the recipient recovering from packet losses with an interesting approach on applying AL-FEC error protection introduces deterministic or randomized online algorithms. Based on this we present a novel online scheme on applying AL-FEC application on the context of the AL-FEC policy online problem. In this work we present an online algorithm based on feedback received from mobile end-users which adapts the introduced protection based on this. Another aspect of this work is the utilization of AL-FEC protection on the edge level based on RaptorQ FEC codes.",

First, we introduce an algorithm that determines the spectrum allocation of femtocells' hybrid access. The algorithm aims to compensate for the performance reduction of subscribed users, due to reduced spectrum.

The fairness problem results from the fact that Clients with different capabilities have to be served. In our application we use a mechanism that categorizes the Clients into a number of groups according to each Client's capabilities and (the mechanism) serves each group of Clients with a different multicast stream. With the term \u201ccapabilities\u201d we do not only mean the processing power of the Client, but also the capacity and the condition of the network path towards that Client.

There is a definite need for many persons to design their space along with an expert and to preview it in order to test its functionality. Many times there is a need for the inhabitants and workers to collaborate in order to co-design their space from distance. Multi-user 3D virtual environments are a powerful form of collaborative telecommunication applications, enabling the users to share a common three dimensional space and interact with each other as well as with the environment surrounding them, in order to collaboratively solve problems or aid learning processes. This paper presents the work done for extending a multi-user virtual environments platform, to support collaborative spatial design applications.

We based our implementation on an existing theoretical model and focused on resolving problems and removing assumptions which made it inefficient in real life implementation. The initial model manages to minimize the power consumption in networks with exactly two nodes. In this paper, we extend the model to consider the possibility of the existence of a base station, where any number of nodes can be connected. Our objectives for the base station are to minimize the power consumption and guarantee continuous connectivity for all mobile nodes. We implement the \u2026",

There are two major issues that have to be considered when designing and implementing such a mechanism, the fairness, which is the ability to cope with receiver heterogeneity, and the adaptation schemes. The proposed mechanism uses a friendly to the network users congestion control policy to control the transmission of the data. We evaluate the adaptive multicast transmission mechanism through a number of simulations in order to examine its behaviour to a heterogeneous group of receivers and its behaviour against TCP and UDP data streams.

The IEEE 802.11 f Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP), handles the Layer 2 (L2) mobility of STAs during L2 (intra-network) handovers, and offers IP connectivity via L2 specific methods. Instead of using a different protocol for the L3 mobility management of STAs, such as Mobile IP (MIP)[4] or a MIP-variant, the IAPP protocol is extended so as to also support the inter-network (L3) movements of 802.11 STAs. The proposed IAPP-based mechanism supports host mobility and offers substantial uninterrupted wireless IP-connectivity, even after L3 movements. The cornerstones of this mechanism are the zero-delay IP movement detection and the zero over-the-air IP signaling during IP handover establishment, which lead to seamless (very fast) and smooth IP handoffs. This fast IP-handoff method is especially suitable to 802.11 systems, as it has better performance than traditional MIP-based methods (shorter handover delays, near zero packet loss), while makes IP roaming transparent to the mobile STAs.",

In this approach, the transmission rate of the multimedia data is determined as a function of the packet loss rate, the round trip time and the packet size and the server explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of these parameters. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the UMTS for real\u2010time video transmission using real\u2010time protocols. Through a number of experiments, we measure performance parameters such as end\u2010to\u2010end delay, delay in radio access network, delay jitter and throughput in the wireless link.

One of the most promising technologies that aim to provide long-distance transmission while retaining energy consumption at low levels, is Long Range (LoRa). In this paper, a thorough study of the energy efficiency in LoRa based Search and Rescue (SAR) project for people with special needs, called Wearable based Search And Rescue system (WeSAR) is presented. After research the authors propose a LoRa based system, taking into consideration the energy efficiency. The results of the proposed mechanism are encouraging in terms of energy consumption, and the battery can last enough for the majority of the SAR operations, even when the battery is not fully charged.

            "Abstract": "This paper describes an extension of the mobility support for the IPv6 protocol, which is currently an Internet Draft. We argue that by processing geographical data information a mobile node can efficiently switch between different LANs without disturbance to ongoing data sessions. Furthermore the number of location update messages diminishes as the mobile node transmits them only when switching to a new LAN. This extension requires that each router of the foreign networks the mobile node visits, advertises the GPS coordinates of x points that describe its region. It also requires that the mobile node is capable of receiving GPS signals. Once having collected this information the mobile node can safely figure whether it will continue to be served by the same LAN or it has to switch to a different one because soon it will be out of the old LAN\u2019s range. Furthermore using this information the mobile node can also decide to which LAN it is preferable to switch. Lower-layer information, when it is available, such as signal strength or signal quality can be used as auxiliary indications for the switch decision.",

In such cases voice and video transmission is essential to form a global view of the situation and decide on action. However, MANETs do not seem to effectively support multimedia applications and especially video transmission. In this work we propose a simple and efficient channel selection mechanism for enhancing Video Transmission in MANETS that have nodes with multiple interfaces, and can utilize multiple channels at the same time. The mechanism is implemented and tested in the ns-2 network simulator. Simulation results indicate that the mechanism improves the networks capacity for video transmission and reduces the video streams\u2019 packet delay.",

Longterm evolution (LTE), the evolutionary successor of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) networks, addresses this emerging trend, by shaping the future mobile broadband landscape. LTE promises a richer, more immersive environment that significantly increases peak data rates and spectral efficiency. However, the plethora of mobile multimedia services that are expected to face high penetration, poses the need for the deployment of a resource economic scheme. Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), also called Evolved MBMS (E-MBMS) in LTE terminology, constitutes an efficient way to compensate for this necessity since it allows resources\u2019 sharing during data transmission [1, 2].The main requirement during the provision of MBMS multicast services is to make an efficient overall usage of radio and network resources. The system should conceive and adapt to continuous changes that occur in such dynamic wireless environments and optimally allocate resources. To this direction, a critical aspect of MBMS performance is the selection of the most efficient radio bearer, in terms of power consumption, for the transmission of multimedia traffic. The selection of the most efficient radio bearer is an open issue in today\u2019s MBMS infrastructure and several mechanisms have been proposed to this direction. Nevertheless, the selection of the most appropriate mechanism is plagued with uncertainty, since each mechanism may \u2026",

This can create severe impact on the protocol's transport plane when a fault occurs to a link or path with many optical connections attached to it. This paper proposes the implementation of an improved GMPLS recovery algorithm based on the metric of optical link delay which is achieved through the pre or post selection of a safer and more stable protection path with fewer connections attached to it, and therefore with a lesser link delay metric compared to other possible paths.

The most prominent features of SRAMT-LE are its distributed (to sender and receivers) transmission rate estimation algorithm and its innovative RTT (Round Trip Time) estimation algorithm based on one-way delay measurements. In addition, SRAMT-LE adjusts the transmission rates of the layers in order to service better the group of the receivers. SRAMT-LE is using both a TCP model and an AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) algorithm in order to estimate a TCP friendly bandwidth share. With the use of SRAMT-LE, we ensure that sender will transmit TCP friendly traffic and receivers with different capabilities (in terms of available bandwidth) are able to receive the multimedia information. We evaluate SRAMT-LE through a number of simulations in order to examine its behaviour to a heterogeneous group of receivers and its behaviour against TCP connections. Main conclusion of the simulations was that SRAMT-LE has friendly behaviour against the dominant traffic types of today\u2019s Internet and treats a heterogeneous group of receivers with fairness.",

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a mechanism for the congestion control for video transmission over Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). Our scheme is applied when the mobile user experiences real time multimedia content and adopts the theory of a widely accepted rate control method in wired networks, namely equation\u2010based rate control. In this approach, the transmission rate of the multimedia data is determined as a function of the packet loss rate, the round trip time and the packet size and the server explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of these parameters. Through a number of simulations and experiments we validate the correctness and measure the performance and efficiency of the mechanism. A first level of evaluation is carried out using the ns\u20102 simulator. A second level then validates the proposed mechanism in real world traffic scenarios by performing experiments in a commercial \u2026",

To this direction, the use of forward error correction (FEC) on the application layer is widely adopted in several mobile multicast standards. FEC is a feedback free error control method, where the transmitter introduces in advance redundant information within the source data to enable receivers recovering arbitrary data erasures. On multicast delivery where retransmission-based error recovery methods are not efficient, the most suitable error control method is the use of application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) codes. In this work, we introduce novel AL-FEC deployment policies over mobile multicast environments utilizing online algorithms.

            "Abstract": "Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) was introduced in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 6 in order to address the need for the efficient usage of the expensive radio resources. The goal of this effort is to support downlink streaming and download-and-play type services to large groups of users. From the radio perspective, MBMS includes point-to-point (PtP) and point-to-multipoint (PtM) modes. The fact that Node B's transmission power is a limited resource and must be shared among all MBMS users in a cell indicates the need for power control during an MBMS service. Consequently, the analysis of the transmitted power plays a fundamental role in the planning and optimization process of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) radio access networks. In this paper we investigate the factors that affect the Node B's transmission power levels during an MBMS session \u2026",

Even though WLANs offer very high channel bandwidth, they show long network-layer handoff latency. This is a restraining factor for mobile clients using interactive multimedia applications such as voice over IP (VoIP) or video streaming. The paper presents an 802.11-dependent fast IP handoff method which quickly restores IP connectivity for mobile clients running next generation WLAN applications such as voice over WLANs (VoWLAN). This method outperforms other existing proposed IP mobility solutions in 802.11 WLANs as verified from real performance testing, while introducing insignificant compulsory additions to the existing 802.11 wireless LAN framework.",

Although evidence shows that broadband development is increasing, this increment is not homogeneous between urban and rural areas. The main cause is the high cost for deploying next generation networks in rural areas, and especially the cost linked to civil engineering works. In order to overcome the investment challenges arising in the context of broadband deployment, the European Commission made mandatory the sharing of existing telecommunication and non-telecommunication infrastructures and facilities. This paper proposes and presents a novel tool that enables the estimation of the expected savings from exploiting existing infrastructures when deploying a broadband network.

This project was driven by the increasing demand for reliable and guaranteed data transportation for scientific purposes. In order to implement the process of information exchange in a multidomain heterogeneous environment several design decisions have to take place, in order to balance and satisfy by the needs of information security, fast information dissemination, efficient request processing, reliability and robustness. The paper describes how AutoBAHN implements a flexible AAI in a distributed environment, how it exchanges and updates information and how it handles incoming requests in an efficient and timely manner. The multi-domain aspect of this effort stems from the fact that the tool is used in the production environment of several cooperating National Research and Educational Networks (NRENs) across Europe. Each NREN may have different underlying technologies, different policies and different use cases, but they all have to coordinate through usage of the AutoBAHN tool in order to produce a multidomain service of circuit reservation.",

A significant point of the demanding multimedia services is the enhancement of the robustness against packet losses. To this direction, in order to support the efficient point-to-multipoint download and streaming delivery, 3GPP has included an Application Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) scheme in the MBMS standard. The standardized AL-FEC scheme is based on the systematic, fountain Raptor codes. In this paper, we investigate the application of AL-FEC over the MBMS streaming delivery method.

As available software and hardware is designed to handle IPv4 packets, there is a need to accurately measure the performance of QoS mechanisms in an IPv6 environment. This paper discusses tests in the deployment of IPv6 QoS in core networks, namely the production dual stack GRNET and the IPv6-only 6NET networks, using both hardware and software platforms. In either case, we succeeded in delivering advanced transport services to IPv6 traffic and provided different performance guarantees to portions of traffic. The deployed QoS schema was common for IPv6 and IPv4; in most cases both v4 and v6 traffic exhibited comparable performance per class while imposing no significantly different overhead on network elements. A major conclusion of our tests is that the IPv6 QoS mechanisms are efficiently supported with state-of-the-art router cards at gigabit speeds.",

            "Abstract": "Long Term Evolution (LTE) constitutes the latest step before the 4th generation (4G) of radio technologies designed to increase the capacity and speed of mobile communications. To support Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMS), LTE offers the functionality to transmit MBMS over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN), where a time-synchronized common waveform is transmitted from multiple cells for a given duration. In MBSFN transmissions, the achieved Spectral Efficiency (SE) is mainly determined by the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selected. This study proposes and evaluates four approaches for the selection of the MCS that will be utilized for the transmission of the MBSFN data. The evaluation of the approaches is performed for different users\u2019 distribution and from a SE perspective. Based on the SE measurement, the approach that either maximizes or achieves a target SE for the \u2026",

Femtocells will play a major role in these heterogeneous networks, being a low-cost and effective solution. In this paper we propose a mechanism on management of femtocells' resources, based on spectrum allocation policies, power control and user classification. We combine hybrid access operation with user redistribution to provide a complete mechanism for resource allocation in dense femtocell deployments. Simulations show that the proposed scheme increases the capacity provided by the involved femtocells, it guarantees service to non-subscribers and balances the performance of the subscribed users improving the worst cases.",

From the radio perspective, MBMS includes point-to-point (PtP) and point-to-multipoint (PtM) modes. The latter aims to overcome network congestion when a large number of users request the same content. One of the most important aspects in MBMS is power control. The fact that Node B's transmission power is a limited resource and must be shared among all MBMS users in a cell indicates the need for power control during an MBMS service.

The procedures that could be followed by Internet users in order to publish content on the web till now, were to either buy and read some books on HTML and have some basic knowledge on Web Servers, or pay an ISP a quite substantial amount of money to do it for them. In this paper we first justify the necessity of the existence of an alternative method for online web publishing. We then describe the method and a tool, called e-DEDALUS, which can be used by many diverse Internet user groups. An Internet user that has no previous experience in programming, or desktop design, will be able to create his/her own Web site, online.

One limiting factor that influences LTE performance is the interference from neighbouring cells, the so called Inter-Cell Interference (ICI). The investigation of ICI mitigation techniques has become a key focus area in achieving dense spectrum reuse in next generation cellular systems. Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) has been proposed as a technique to overcome this problem, since it can efficiently utilize the available frequency spectrum. This manuscript proposes a dynamic mechanism that selects the optimal FFR scheme based on a custom metric, which is called user satisfaction.

The DiffServ mechanism for providing QoS guarantees, is generally preferred over IntServ. However, the current support for QoS mechanisms in IPv6 implementations still lags behind QoS support in IPv4. Furthermore, the new Internet Protocol introduces a different network environment in many aspects and therefore the QoS services should be specifically designed and evaluated for IPv6. In order to evaluate this different behaviour, large-scale experiments have been carried out within the scope of the 6NET project. This paper describes the results from the experimentation with the DiffServ mechanism on a large-scale native IPv6 network that aims to service aggregates of real time traffic with minimum delay, jitter and packet loss.",

The study presented in this paper focuses on the impact of integrating femtocells in macrocell networks in terms of adjacent cell interference that the macrocell environment adds to users served by a femto base station and vice versa.

To support Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMS), LTE offers the possibility to transmit Multimedia Broadcast multicast service over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN), where a time-synchronized common waveform is transmitted from multiple cells for a given duration. This enables over-the-air combining, thus improving the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and spectral efficiency (SE) significantly compared to conventional MBMS operation. In this paper, we analytically calculate the SE performance achieved in a MBSFN area for a dynamically changing user topology and different modulation and coding schemes (MCS).

Introduced in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Release 6, the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMS) framework aims at the efficient usage of network and radio resources for the transmission of multimedia services. The main requirement during the provision of MBMS multicast services is to minimize the transmission power of UMTS base stations. To this direction, several mechanisms have been proposed that either allow a simultaneous deployment of Point-to-Point (PTP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PTM) transmissions, or a single transport channel deployment (PTP or PTM) in a cell at any given time. Main objective of this paper is to study these \u2026",

Trace files produced by NS-2 provide very useful information for post simulation analysis. This paper presents the architecture and development considerations for a TRAce FILe analysis tool, which intends to simplify the management of trace files generated during network simulations. The tool is focused on NS-2 trace files, but can be extended to handle a variety of simulation trace files formats. Its purpose is to make the execution of a large number of network simulations faster, and the extraction of results from a large amount of data more flexible and productive. TRAFIL introduces a novel way of interpreting, parsing, reading and eventually utilizing NS-2 trace files by using\" metafiles\" and\" sub-metafiles\" during the trace file recognition and process procedures, making the overall operations more abstract, substantially efficient and faster than alternative approaches. Furthermore, TRAFIL facilitates the whole trace file analysis task, offering the opportunity to store each trace file as well as every measurement produced for each trace file. The tool aims to aid the analysis of simulation results offering features that other tools in this area have been missing. 1",

A key new feature of LTE is the possibility to exploit the Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface to transmit multicast or broadcast data as a multicell transmission over a synchronized Single Frequency Network (SFN): this is known as Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) operation. MBSFN transmission enables a more efficient operation of the MBMS (3GPP, 2008a), allowing over-the-air combining of multi-cell transmissions towards the User Equipments (UEs). This fact makes the MBSFN transmission appear to the UE as a transmission from a single larger cell. Transmission on a dedicated carrier for MBSFN with the possibility to use a longer Cyclic Prefix (CP) with a sub-carrier bandwidth of 7.5 kHz is supported as well as transmission of MBSFN on a carrier with both MBMS transmissions and point-to-point (PTP) transmissions using time division multiplexing. MBMS service defines two delivery methods: the download and the streaming delivery. There are many ways to provide reliability in multicast transmission. The best-known method that operates efficiently for unicast transmission is the Automatic Repeat re-Quest (ARQ). When ARQ is applied in a multicast session, receivers send requests for retransmission of lost packets over a back channel towards the sender.

            "Abstract": "This paper proposes a mechanism for the congestion control for video transmission over UMTS. Our scheme is applied when the mobile user experiences real time multimedia content and adopts the theory of a widely accepted rate control method in wired networks, namely equation based rate control. In this approach, the transmission rate of the multimedia data is determined as a function of the packet loss rate, the round trip time and the packet size and the server explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of these parameters. Through a number of simulations and experiments we validate the correctness and measure the performance and efficiency of the mechanism. The mechanism at first level is evaluated through simulations that carried out in the ns-2 simulator. At second level, in order to validate the proposed mechanism in real world traffic scenarios we perform some experiments in a commercial UMTS network.",

Following the rapid increase in penetration rate of broadband services, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently standardizing the Evolved-Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (E-MBMS) framework of Long Term Evolution (LTE), the successor of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). MBMS constitutes a point-to-multipoint downlink bearer service that was designed to significantly decrease the required radio and wired link resources. However, several obstacles regarding the high-power requirements should be overcome for the realization of MBMS.

We first prove that a vast amount of redundant data is transferred in Web pages that are considered to carry fresh data. We show this by following an approach based on Web page fragmentation and manipulation. Web pages are broken down to fragments, based on specific criteria. We then deal with these fragments as independent constructors of the Web page and study their change patterns independently and in the context of the whole Web page.

ASMP consists of a single-rate multicast congestion control, which takes advantage of the RTCP sender (SR) and receiver reports (RR) in order to adjust the sender's transmission rate in respect of the network conditions. The innovation in ASMP lays in the \"smooth\" transmission rate, which is TCP-friendly and prevent oscillations. We use an integrated simulation environment named Multi-Evalvid-RA for the evaluation of the two congestion control schemes. Multi-Evalvid-RA provides all the necessary tools to perform simulation studies and assess the video quality by using both network related metrics along with video quality measurements. The performance evaluation results show that ASMP is a very efficient solution \u2026",

A new class of classification problems; called \u2018scalable\u2019, is introduced, with applications on web mining. Scalable classification utilizes newly classified instances in order to improve the accuracy of future classifications and capture changes in semantic representation of different topics. In addition, definition of different similarity classes is allowed, resulting in a \u2018per-user\u2019classification procedure. Such an approach provides a new methodology for building personalized applications. This is due to the fact that the user becomes a part of the classification procedure. We explore solutions for the scalable text classification problem and introduce an algorithm that exploits a new text analysis technique that decomposes documents into the vector representation of their sentences according to the user expertise. Finally, a web-based personalized news categorization system that bases upon this approach is presented.",

In order to provide reliable multicast transmission, 3GPP recommends exclusively for MBMS the use of a Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism on the application layer. Raptor codes are standardized as the Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) scheme over 3GPP MBMS. However, the 3GPP standardized systematic fountain Raptor code is nowadays considered obsolete, since a new variation of the Raptor codes has emerged. This enhanced AL-FEC scheme, named RaptorQ, promises higher protection efficiency and superior flexibility on the provision of demanding mobile multicast services. In this work, we provide an extensive performance evaluation presenting at first a theoretical performance comparison of the newly introduced RaptorQ FEC scheme with its predecessor Raptor code, examining the enhancements that RaptorQ introduces on the AL-FEC protection robustness. Thereafter, to verify the enhanced performance of RaptorQ, we present several simulation results considering the modeling of the AL-FEC protection over multicast services for next generation mobile networks, utilizing the ns-3 simulation environment. Investigating several mobile system parameters in conjunction with FEC encoding parameters, we provide valuable results regarding the impacts of the examined AL-FEC schemes application on the multicast services performance.",

Due to increased demands for usage over several devices in heterogenous networks, large disparities in the Downlink pose a threat to the quality of services rendered by the network and this technique seems obsolete. Uplink and Downlink decoupling is the proposed solution, where the Downlink cell association is not necessarily based on the same criteria as Uplink.
