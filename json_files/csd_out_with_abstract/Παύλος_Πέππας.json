            "Abstract": "It is widely accepted nowadays that the ability of a firm to display sustained competitive advantage, relies heavily on its efficiency in managing organisational knowledge, and keeping it up-to-date with internal and external developments. It is therefore imperative to develop a deeper understanding of organisational knowledge evolution. In this paper, we propose the use of methods and techniques from the area of Belief Revision in studying organisational knowledge dynamics. Belief Revision lies at the intersection of Formal Philosophy and Computer Science, and studies the process by which a rational agent changes her beliefs in the light of new information. The formal models that have been developed in this area are intuitive and elegant, and in this paper we show how they can be imported into the context of organisational knowledge management.",

Fitting in 1992, every modal language is based on an underlying Heyting algebra which provides the space of truth values. The lattice of truth values is explicitly represented in the language by a set of special constants and this allows for forming weak, generalized, many-valued analogs of all classical modal axioms. Weak axioms of this kind have been recently investigated from the canonicity, completeness and correspondence perspective. In this paper, we provide some results on the effect of adopting weak versions of the axioms D, T, 4, 5 and w5 in the family of many-valued modal non-monotonic logics, \u00e0 la McDermott and Doyle, introduced in [4] and further investigated in [7].

The new type of belief change is called set contraction. Zhang and Foo also introduced a constructive model for set contraction, called nicely ordered partition, as a generalization of epistemic entrenchment. It was shown however that the functions induced from nicely ordered partitions do not quite match the postulates for set contraction. The mismatch was fixed with the introduction of an extra condition called the limit postulate. The limit postulate establishes a connection between contraction by infinite epistemic input and contraction by finite epistemic input (reducing the former to the latter) and it is appealing both on mathematical and on conceptual grounds. It is debatable however whether the limit postulate can be adopted as a general feature of rationality in set contraction. Instead we \u2026",

Yet, for a theory of action to qualify as a solution to the frame problem, not only does it need to produce correct inferences, but moreover, it needs to derive these inferences from a concise representation of the domain at hand. The new methodology however offers no means for assessing conciseness. Such a formal account of conciseness is developed in this paper. Combined with the existing criterion for correctness, our account of conciseness offers a framework where proposed solutions to the frame problem can be formally evaluated.",

            "Abstract": "The AGM paradigm for belief change, as originally introduced by Alchourron, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson, lacks any guidelines for the process of iterated revision. One of the most influential work addressing this problem is Darwiche and Pearl's approach (DP approach, for short), which, despite its well-documented shortcomings, remains to this date the most dominant. In this article, we make further observations on the DP approach. In particular, we prove that the DP postulates are, in a strong sense, inconsistent with Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom (P), extending previous initial conflicts. Immediate consequences of this result are that an entire class of intuitive revision operators, which includes Dalal's operator, violates the DP postulates, as well as that the Independence postulate and Spohn's conditionalization are inconsistent with axiom (P). The whole study, essentially, indicates that two fundamental aspects of the revision process, namely, iteration and relevance, are in deep conflict, and opens the discussion for a potential reconciliation towards a comprehensive formal framework for knowledge dynamics.",

            "Abstract": "A central result in the AGM framework for belief revision is the construction of revisionfunctions in terms of total preorders on possible worlds. These preorders encode comparative plausibility: r< r'states that the world r is at least as plausible as r'. Indifference in the plausibility of two worlds, r, r', denoted r~ r', is defined as the absence of a preference between r and r'. Herein we take a closer look at plausibility indifference. We contend that the transitivity of indifference assumed in the AGM framework is not always a desirable property for comparative plausibility. Our argument originates from similar concerns in preference modelling, where a structure weaker than a total preorder, called a semiorder, is widely consider to be a more adequate model of preference. In this paper we essentially re-construct revision functions using semiorders instead of total preorders. We formulate postulates to characterisethis new, wider, class of revision functions, and prove that the postulates are sound and complete with respect to the semiorder-based construction. The corresponding class of contraction functions (via theLevi and Harper Identities) is also characterised axiomatically.",

Loosely speaking, this principle dictates that the revision policies employed by a rational agent at different belief sets, are not independent, but ought to be related in a certain way. We formalise kinetic consistency axiomatically and semantically, and we establish a representation result explicitly connecting the two. We then combine the postulates for kinetic consistency, with Parikh\u2019s postulate for relevant change, and add them to the classical AGM postulates for revision; we call this augmented set the extended AGM postulates. We prove the consistency and demonstrate the scope of the extended AGM postulates by showing that a whole new class of concrete revision operators introduced hererin, called PD operators, satisfies all extended AGM postulates \u2026",

We assume that relevance is a domain-specific notion, and that (ir) relevance assertions are given as part of the agent's epistemic state. Such assertions apply in a given context, and are of the form``in the case that formula\\sigma holds, the Y part of the agent's epistemic state is independent of the rest of the epistemic state'', where Y is part of the signature of the language. Two approaches are given, one in which (in semantic terms) conditions are placed on a faithful ranking on possible worlds to enforce the (ir) relevance assertions, and a second in which the possible worlds characterising the agent's beliefs may be modified in a revision. These approaches are shown to yield the same resulting belief set. Corresponding postulates and a representation result are given. The overall approach is compared to that of Parikh's for language splitting as well as with multivalued dependencies in relational databases.",

The primary aim of this paper is to provide an augmented preferential semantics that is general enough to unify two prominent frameworks for reasoning about action and causality\u2014Sandewall's causal propagation semantics [4] and Thielscher's causal relationships approach [5].

In short, axiom (P) states that, if a belief set  can be divided into two disjoint compartments, and the new information  relates only to the first compartment, then the revision of  by  should not affect the second compartment. Accordingly, we identify the subclass of epistemic-entrenchment and that of selection-function preorders, inducing AGM revision functions that satisfy axiom (P). Hence, together with the faithful-preorders characterization of (P) that has already been provided, Parikh's axiom is fully characterized in terms of all popular constructive models of Belief Revision. Since the notions of relevance and local change are inherent in almost all intellectual activity, the completion of the constructive view of (P) has a significant impact on many theoretical, as well as applied, domains of Artificial Intelligence.",

            "Abstract": "In the past few years, several approaches for revision (and update) of logic programs have been studied. None of these however matched the generality and elegance of the original AGM approach to revision in classical logic. One particular obstacle is the underlying nonmonotonicity of the semantics of logic programs. Recently however, specific revision operators based on the monotonic concept of SE-models (which underlies the answer-set semantics of logic programs) have been proposed. Basing revision of logic programs on sets of SE-models has the drawback that arbitrary sets of SE-models may not necessarily be expressed via a logic program. This situation is similar to the emerging topic of revision in fragments of classical logic. In this paper we show how nonetheless classical AGM-style revision can be extended to various classes of logic programs using the concept of SE-models. That is, we \u2026",

Loosely speaking, axiom (P) states that if a belief set K can be divided into two disjoint compartments, and the new information \u03d5 relates only to the first compartment, then the second compartment should not be effected by the revision of K by \u03d5. Using the well-known connection between AGM revision functions and preorders on possible worlds as our starting point, we formulate additional constraints on such preorders that characterise precisely Parikh's axiom (P). Interestingly, the additional constraints essentially generalise a criterion of plausibility between possible worlds that predates axiom (P). A by-product of our study is the identification of two possible readings of Parikh's axiom (P), which we call the strong and the weak versions of the axiom. Regarding specific operators, we show that Dalal \u2026",

In addition, a unifying semantic framework for different reasoning approaches provides an ideal tool to compare these competing alternatives. It has been shown recently that a pure preferential semantics alone is not capable of providing such a unifying framework for a class of action theories dealing with causality. On the other hand, variants of preferential semantics augmented by additional structures on the state space have been successfully used to characterise some influential approaches to causal reasoning about action. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a general unifying semantics for Sandewall\u2019s causal propagation semantics [Sandewall, 1996] and McCain-Turner causal fixed-points approach [McCain and Turner, 1995].",

One of the hurdles in implementing revision operators is that their specification (let alone their computation), requires substantial resources. On the other hand, implementing a specific revision operator, like Dalal's operator, would be of limited use. In a recent paper we generalised Dalal's construction defining a whole family of concrete revision operators, called Parametrised Difference revision operators or PD operators for short. This family is wide enough to cover a whole range of different applications, and at the same time it is easy to represent. In this paper we characterise axiomatically the family of PD operators, study its computational complexity, and discuss its benefits for belief revision implementations.",

Recently the original axiomatization of revision and contraction was extended to include epistemic input represented by a (possibly infinite) set of sentences (as opposed to a single sentence) giving rise to the operators of set revision (also known as multiple revision) and set contraction. Both set revision and set contraction have been characterized in terms of constructive models called system of spheres and epistemic grasp respectively. Based on these links, in this paper we provide a characterization of set contraction in terms of system of spheres, and we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the system-of-spheres model and the epistemic-grasp model give rise to the same set contraction.",

            "Abstract": "This paper investigates belief revision where the underlying logic is that governing Horn clauses. It proves to be the case that classical (AGM) belief revision doesn\u2019t immediately generalise to the Horn case. In particular, a standard construction based on a total preorder over possible worlds may violate the accepted (AGM) postulates. Conversely, Horn revision functions in the obvious extension to the AGM approach are not captured by total preorders over possible worlds. We address these difficulties by first restricting the semantic construction to\" well behaved\" orderings; and second, by augmenting the revision postulates by an additional postulate. This additional postulate is redundant in the AGM approach but not in the Horn case. In a representation result we show that these two approaches coincide. Arguably this work is interesting for several reasons. It extends AGM revision to inferentially-weaker Horn theories; hence it sheds light on the theoretical underpinnings of belief change, as well as generalising the AGM paradigm. Thus, this work is relevant to revision in areas that employ Horn clauses, such as deductive databases and logic programming, as well as areas in which inference is weaker than classical logic, such as in description logic.",

This is unfortunate, for systems and automata theory have much to offer by way of insight into problems raised in the logics of action. This paper is an outline of how the input-output view of systems and its associated solution of state realization may be applied to the formalization of dynamics that uses a situation calculus approach. In particular, because the latter usually admits incompletely specified dynamics, which induces a non-deterministic input-output system behavior, we first show that \u2026",

In a previous article, [7], we argued that this is not always the case, and we introduced new sets of postulates for revision and contraction (weaker variants of the classical AGM postulates), that are liberated from the indifference transitivity assumption. Herein we complete the task by making the necessary adjustments to the epistemic entrenchment and the partial meet models. In particular we lift the indifference transitivity assumption from both these two models, and we establish representation results connecting the weaker models with the weaker postulates for contraction introduced in [7].",

Notwithstanding the extensive work on iterated belief revision, there is, still, no fully satisfactory solution within the classical AGM paradigm. The seminal work of Darwiche and Pearl (DP approach, for short) remains the most dominant, despite its well-documented shortcomings. In this article, we make further observations on the DP approach. Firstly, we prove that the DP postulates are, in a strong sense, inconsistent with Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom (P), extending previous initial conflicts. Immediate consequences of this result are that an entire class of intuitive revision operators, which includes Dalal's operator, violates the DP postulates, as well as that the Independence postulate and Spohn's conditionalization are inconsistent with (P). Lastly, we show that the DP postulates allow for more revision polices than the ones that can be captured by identifying belief states with total preorders over possible worlds, a fact implying that a preference ordering (over possible worlds) is an insufficient representation for a belief state.",

In this article, we show that - although not in a straightforward way - a sufficient extension of the underlying language allows for the modelling of any AGM revision function (defined at the initial language), by means of a Hamming-based rule for belief revision introduced by Dalal (defined at the extended language). The established results enrich the applicability of Dalal's proposal, leading to a conceptual and ontological reduction, as well as open new doors for the construction of any type of revision function in a practical context, given the intuitive appeal and simplicity of Dalal's construction.",

            "Abstract": "The AGM approach to belief change is not geared to provide a decent account of iterated belief change. Darwiche and Pearl have sought to extend the AGM proposal in an interesting way to deal with this problem. We show that the original Darwiche\u2013Pearl approach is, on the one hand excessively strong and, on the other rather limited in scope. The later Darwiche\u2013Pearl approach, we argue, although it addresses the first problem, still remains rather permissive. We address both these issues by (1) assuming a dynamic revision operator that changes to a new revision operator after each instance of belief change, and (2) strengthening the Darwiche\u2013Pearl proposal. Moreover, we provide constructions of this dynamic revision operator via entrenchment kinematics as well as a simple form of lexicographic revision, and prove representation results connecting these accounts.",

The extended framework includes epistemic input represented as a (possibly infinite) set of sentences, as opposed to a single sentence assumed in the original framework. The transition from single to multiple epistemic input worked out well for the operation of belief revision. The AGM postulates and the system-of-spheres model were adequately generalized and so was the representation result connecting the two. In the case of belief contraction however, the transition was not as smooth. The generalized postulates for contraction, which were shown to correspond precisely to the generalized partial meet model, failed to match up to the generalized epistemic entrenchment model. The mismatch was fixed with the addition of an extra postulate, called the limit \u2026",

A by-product of our study is the identification of two possible readings of Parikh\u2019s axiom (P), which we call the strong and the weak versions of the axiom. An interesting feature of the strong version is that, unlike classical AGM belief revision, it makes associations between the revision policies of different theories.",

The standard (AGM) approach to belief revision assumes that the underlying logic contains classical propositional logic.

In this paper we consider the question of what the minimal requirements are on a logic, such that the AGM approach to revision may be formulated. We show that AGM-style revision can be obtained even when extremely little is assumed of the underlying language and its semantics; in fact, one requires little more than a language with sentences that are satisfied at models, or possible worlds. The classical AGM postulates are expressed in this framework and a representation result is established between the postulate set and certain preorders on possible worlds. To obtain the representation result, we add a new postulate to the AGM postulates, and we add a constraint to preorders on worlds. Crucially, both of these additions are redundant in the original AGM framework, and so we extend, rather than modify, the AGM approach. As well, iterated revision is addressed and shown to be compatible with our approach. Various examples are given to illustrate the approach, including Horn clause revision, revision in extended logic programs, and belief revision in a very basic logic called literal revision.",

We introduce interesting generalized forms of the classical axioms D, T, B, 4, and 5 and prove that they are canonical for certain algebraic frame properties, which generalize seriality, reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and euclideanness. Our results are quite general as they hold for any modal language built on a complete Heyting algebra.",

            "Abstract": "This paper investigates belief revision where the underlying logic is that governing Horn clauses. It proves to be the case that classical (AGM) belief revision doesn\u2019t immediately generalise to the Horn case. In particular, a standard construction based on a total preorder over possible worlds may violate the accepted (AGM) postulates. Conversely, Horn revision functions in the obvious extension to the AGM approach are not captured by total preorders over possible worlds. We address these difficulties by first restricting the semantic construction to \u201cwell behaved\u201d orderings; and second, by augmenting the revision postulates by an additional postulate. This additional postulate is redundant in the AGM approach but not in the Horn case. In a representation result we show that these two approaches coincide. Arguably this work is interesting for several reasons. It extends AGM revision to inferentially-weaker Horn theories; hence it sheds light on the theoretical underpinnings of belief change, as well as generalising the AGM paradigm. Thus, this work is relevant to revision in areas that employ Horn clauses, such as deductive databases and logic programming, as well as areas in which inference is weaker than classical logic, such as in description logic.",

It is our purpose here to objectively test these claims in an abstract sense; to determine whether an explicit representation of causality is capable of providing something that the Principle of Minimal Change is unable to capture.

This paper provides the missing part, thus closing the circle. Here we show that the invariants extracted by our method can be tested by using them to complete partial specifications that may match those which were used as inputs to the extraction phase.

            "Abstract": "In 1985, David Makinson, together with Carlos Alchourron and Peter G\u00e4rdenfors published an article, the now renowned \u201cAGM paper\u201d, that gave rise to an entire new area of research: Belief Revision. The AGM paper set the stage for studying belief revision and provided the first fundamental results in the area. There was however one aspect of belief revision that was not addressed in the AGM paper: iterated belief revision. Since 1985, there have been numerous attempts to tackle this problem. In this chapter, we shall review some of the most influential approaches to the problem of iterated belief revision, and discuss their strengths and shortcomings.",

            "Abstract": "We re-visit the problem of converting action specifications into system constraints by re-examining it in the very simple setting of STRIPS. This has the merit of making many thorny issues relatively transparent. The paper is in the form of an extended summary of ongoing work and many of the results are merely outlined. But sufficient details are included to indicate where we will be taking things further, and to encourage others to pursue the same objectives. These objectives are in some sense a kind of reverse-engineering, as the database community is evidently familiar with the idea of starting with constraints and then deriving action specifications from them. However in AI reactive systems, action specifications are often the primary entity, so techniques to unearth the implicit constraints can facilitate better designs.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we explore several fundamental relations between formal systems, algorithms, and dynamical systems, focussing on the roles of undecidability, universality, diagonalization, and self-reference in each of these computational frameworks. Some of these interconnections are well-known, while some are clarified in this study as a result of a fine-grained comparison between recursive formal systems, Turing machines, and Cellular Automata (CAs). In particular, we elaborate on the diagonalization argument applied to distributed computation carried out by CAs, illustrating the key elements of G\u00f6del's proof for CAs. The comparative analysis emphasizes three factors which underlie the capacity to generate undecidable dynamics within the examined computational frameworks: (i) the program-data duality; (ii) the potential to access an infinite computational medium; and (iii) the ability to implement negation \u2026",

We show that our new postulate can be reformulated into a postulate for iterated revision, which we call Iterated Recovery (IR), and we prove that (IR) is strictly weaker than Darwiche and Pearl\u2019s second postulate (DP2). We provide possible-world-semantics for (IR) in terms of systems of spheres and we study additional constraints related to (IR) and (DP2).",

Darwiche and Pearl later addressed this problem by introducing extra (intuitive) postulates as a supplement to the AGM ones. A second shortcoming of the AGM paradigm, seemingly unrelated to iterated revision, is that it is too liberal in its treatment of the notion of relevance. Once again this problem was addressed with the introduction of an extra (also very intuitive) postulate by Parikh. The main result of this paper is that Parikh postulate for relevance-sensitive belief revision is inconsistent with each of the Darwiche and Pearl postulates for iterated belief revision.",

            "Abstract": "This paper investigates belief revision where the underlying logic is that governing Horn clauses. We show that classical (AGM) belief revision doesn't immediately generalise to the Horn case. In particular, a standard construction based on a total preorder over possible worlds may violate the accepted (AGM) postulates. Conversely, in the obvious extension to the AGM approach, Horn revision functions are not captured by total preorders over possible worlds. We address these difficulties by introducing two modifications to the AGM approach. First, the semantic construction is restricted to \u201cwell behaved\u201d orderings, what we call Horn compliant orderings. Second, the revision postulates are augmented by an additional postulate. Both restrictions are redundant in the AGM approach, but not in the Horn case. In a representation result we show that the class of revision functions captured by Horn compliant total \u2026",

However, it has been shown recently that a pure preferential semantics alone is not capable of providing such a unifying framework. On the other hand, variants of preferential semantics augmented by additional structures on the state space have been successfully used to characterise some influential approaches to reasoning about action and causality. The primary aim of this paper is to provide an augmented preferential semantics that is general enough to unify two prominent frameworks for reasoning about action and causality\u2014Sandewall\u2019s causal propagation semantics [4] and Thielscher\u2019s causal relationships approach [5]. There are indications that these and other different augmented preferential semantical approaches can by unified into a general framework, and \u2026",
