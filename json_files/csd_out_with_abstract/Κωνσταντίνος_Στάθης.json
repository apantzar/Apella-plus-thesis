            "Abstract": " Recon is an experimental simulation platform that supports the development of software agents interacting concurrently with other agents in negotiation domains. Unlike existing simulation toolkits that support only imperative negotiation strategies, Recon also supports declarative strategies, for applications where logic-based agents need to explain their negotiation decisions to a user. Recon is built on top of the GOLEM agent platform, specialized with a set of infrastructure agents that can manage an electronic market and extract statistics from the negotiations that take place. We evaluate the performance of Recon by showing how by increasing the number of agents in a simulation affects the agents\u2019 time to make an offer during negotiation.",

            "Abstract": " Apriori Stochastic Dependency Detection (ASDD) is an algorithm for fast induction of stochastic logic rules from a database of observations made by an agent situated in an environment. ASDD is based on features of the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules in large databases of sales transactions [1] and the MSDD algorithm for discovering stochastic dependencies in multiple streams of data [15]. Once these rules have been acquired the Precedence algorithm assigns operator precedence when two or more rules matching the input data are applicable to the same output variable. These algorithms currently learn propositional rules, with future extensions aimed towards learning first-order models. We show that stochastic rules produced by this algorithm are capable of reproducing an accurate world model in a simple predator-prey environment.",

            "Abstract": "We propose a method for learning causal relations within high-dimensional tensor data as they are typically recorded in non-experimental databases. The method allows the simultaneous inclusion of numerous dimensions within the data analysis such as samples, time and domain variables construed as tensors. In such tensor data we exploit and integrate non-Gaussian models and tensor analytic algorithms in a novel way. We prove that we can determine simple causal relations independently of how complex the dimensionality of the data is. We rely on a statistical decomposition that flattens higher-dimensional data tensors into matrices. This decomposition preserves the causal information and is therefore suitable for structure learning of causal graphical models, where a causal relation can be generalised beyond dimension, for example, over all time points. Related methods either focus on a set of samples for instantaneous effects or look at one sample for effects at certain time points. We evaluate the resulting algorithm and discuss its performance both with synthetic and real-world data.",

The novel features of the model include: its innovative use of Computational Logic (CL) in a way that facilitates both the formal analysis of the model and its computational realisability directly from the high-level specification of the agents (a first prototype for the development of KGP agents exists, based upon a correct computational counterpart of the model), the modular separation of concerns and flexibility afforded by the model in designing heterogeneous agents and in developing independently the various components of an agent, and the declarative agent control provided through a context-sensitive cycle CL theory component that regulates the agent\u2019s operational behaviour, according to the current circumstances of operation, thus breaking away from the conventional one-size-fits-all control of operation.",

Hence, we worked with international regulators from different countries (the UK, US and Australia), to develop the first decision support tool that aims to help such regulators process complaints more efficiently. Our system uses state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to process complaints and predict their risk level.

Both the knowledge representation framework and its associated infrastructure are highly configurable in the sense that they can be appropriately distributed in order to support real-time responses to agent requests. To exemplify the ideas, we apply the infrastructure on a benchmark scenario for multi-agent systems. Through experimental evaluation we also show how distributing our infrastructure can provide run-time support to large-scale multi-agent systems regulated by norms.",

            "Abstract": "We present a formal framework for decomposing agent interaction protocols to the roles their participants should play. The framework allows an Authority Agent that knows a protocol to compute the protocol\u2019s roles so that it can allocate them to interested parties. We show how the Authority Agent can use the role descriptions to identify problems with the protocol and repair it on the fly, to ensure that participants will be able to implement their role requirements without compromising the protocol\u2019s interactions. Our representation of agent interaction protocols is a game-based one and the decomposition of a game protocol into its constituent roles is based upon the branching bisimulation equivalence reduction of the game. The work extends our previous work on using games to admit agents in an artificial society by checking their competence according to the society rules. The applicability of the overall approach is illustrated by showing how to decompose the NetBill protocol into its roles. We also show how to automatically repair the interactions of a protocol that cannot be implemented in its original form.",

The AEC is a logic-based formalism that is developed here to support the representation of a distributed agent environment as a persistent composite structure evolving over time. Such a complex structure supports the interaction between agents, objects, and containers, entities that have their own external observable state and can be distributed over a network. Interactions between these entities are specified in terms of events that represent actions executed by agents on objects and other agents in the environment. When events happen they are stored in containers and are notified to agent sensors that subscribe to event descriptions and as a result perceive the interactions. The AEC formalism also allows changes caused by events to be delivered across distributed \u2026",

The agent would apply for a role in the society, which would result in its participation in a number of protocols. We advocated the use of the games-based metaphor for describing the protocols and presented a framework for assessing the admission of the agent to the society on the basis of its competence. In this work we look at the subsequent question: what information should the agent receive upon entry?. We can not provide it with the full protocol because of security and overload issues. Therefore, we choose to only provide the actions pertinent to the protocols that the role the agent applied for participates in the society. We employ branching bisimulation for producing a protocol \u2026",

A computational logic agent monitors the patient and provides feedback based on the model whenever the current observations regarding the patient are sufficient to draw a conclusion. In the second approach, we assume a function for the model, and learn its parameters through data. The model is consistently updated via incoming observations about the patients, and allows prediction of possible future values.

This model allows the specification of heterogeneous agents that can interact with each other, and can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in such environments. KGP provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, synthesised within transitions that update the agent's state in response to reasoning, sensing and acting. Transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the dynamic context and agent preferences, as well as selection operators for providing inputs to transitions.",

Assuming that a candidate agent provides an abstract description of their communicative skills, we present a test that a controller agent could perform in order to decide if a candidate agent should be admitted. We formulate this test by revisiting an existing knowledge representation framework based on games specified as extended logic programs.

We provide here an argumentation framework which adopts Knowledge, Goals, Decisions, and Priorities as the main component to perform the individual and social reasoning of agents.

Analogously, the enterprises or other socio-economic systems autonomously manage themselves - they make decisions on how to adapt their structure and behavior, and how to organize with other entities in the environment. To connect internal self-adaptive with external self-organizational behavior, an enterprise is \u201caware\u201d of itself and of its environment, and acts according to this awareness. This position paper proposes to address the challenges of a complex distributed self-managing system by making entities in such a system able to adapt themselves similarly to how companies manage themselves in socio-economic systems.

This second part of the special issue still keeps the notion of local community in the physical neighbourhood but here the attention is diverted to the kind of relationships that the members of such a community may be establishing with other communities, whether local or global, real or virtual, more simple or more complex.

This model allows the specification of heterogeneous agents that can interact with each other, and can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in such environments. KGP provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, synthesised within transitions that update the agents state in response to reasoning, sensing and acting. Transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the dynamic context and agent preferences, as well as selection operators for providing inputs to transitions.",

This form of control is adopted by the KGP model of agency and has been successfully implemented in the PROSOCS platform. We also show how, via cycle theories, we can formally verify properties of agents\u2019 behaviour, focusing on the concrete property of agents\u2019 interruptibility.

            "Abstract": "We study a novel location-aware strategy for distributed systems where cooperating agents perform the load-balancing. The strategy allows agents to identify opportunities within a current unbalanced allocation, which in turn triggers concurrent and one-to-many negotiations amongst agents to locally reallocate some tasks. The tasks are reallocated according to the proximity of the resources and they are performed in accordance with the capabilities of the nodes in which agents are situated. This dynamic and on-going negotiation process takes place concurrently with the task execution and so the task allocation process is adaptive to disruptions (task consumption, slowing down nodes). We evaluate the strategy in a multi-agent deployment of the MapReduce design pattern for processing large datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our strategy significantly improves the overall runtime of the data processing.",

            "Publication year": 2007,
            "Publication url": "https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/2999/",
            "Abstract": "The use of reinforcement learning to guide action selection of cognitive agents has been shown to be a powerful technique for stochastic environments. Standard Reinforcement learning techniques used to provide decision theoretic policies rely, however, on explicit state-based computations of value for each state-action pair. This requires the computation of a number of values exponential to the number of state variables and actions in the system. This research extends existing work with an acquired probabilistic rule representation of an agent environment by developing an algorithm to apply reinforcement learning to values attached to the rules themselves. Structure captured by the rules is then used to learn a policy directly. The resulting value attached to each rule represents the utility of taking an action if the conditions of the rule are present in the agent\u2019s current set of percepts. This has several advantages for planning purposes: generalization over many states and over unseen states; effective decisions can therefore be made with less training data than state based modelling systems (e.g. Dyna Q-Learning); and the problem of computation in an exponential state-action space is alleviated. The results of application of this algorithm to rules in a specific environment are presented, with comparison to standard reinforcement learning policies developed from related work.",

We view agents as black-boxes, whose semantics is abstractly understood as an input-output transformation from the agents\u2019 observations about their environment, to the actions they perform. Stable sets (of actions) characterise multi-agent systems able to reach an equilibrium point. Our semantics via stable sets takes into account the possibility that agents may fail. We illustrate how stability can characterise multi-agent systems by means of examples. We also draw considerations about how stable sets can be effectively approximated.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional Artificial Cognitive Systems (for example, intelligent robots) share a number of limitations. First, they are usually made up only of machine components; humans are only playing the role of user or supervisor. And yet, there are tasks in which the current state of the art of AI has much worse performance or is more expensive than humans: thus, it would be highly beneficial to have a systematic way of creating systems with both human and machine components, possibly with remote non-expert humans providing short-duration real-time services. Second, their components are often dedicated to only one system, and underutilized for a big part of their lifetime. Third, there is no inherent support for robust operation, and if a new better component becomes available, one cannot easily replace the old component. Fourth, they are viewed as a resource to be developed and owned, not as a utility. Thus, we are presenting CLIC: a framework for constructing cognitive systems that overcome the above limitations. The architecture of CLIC provides specific mechanisms for creating and operating cognitive systems that fulfill a set of desiderata: First, that are distributed yet situated, interacting with the physical world though sensing and actuation services, and that are also combining human as well as machine services. Second, that are made up of components that are time-shared and re-usable. Third, that provide increased robustness through self-repair. Fourth, that are constructed and reconstructed on the fly, with components that dynamically enter and exit the system during operation, on the basis of availability, pricing, and need.

First, a number of features are extracted from the data acquired by smartphone sensors, such as the user's location from GPS coordinates and visible wi-fi access points, and the physical activity from accelerometer data. Second, several classifiers trained by machine learning are used to recognise the user's activity, such as work, exercise or eating.

These potential discrepancies raise a number of interesting issues, most notably the problem of checking that the behaviour of an agent is (or will be) conformant to the rules described by a protocol. In this paper, we argue that the ability to merely conform to a protocol is not sufficient for an agent to be a competent user of that protocol. We approach the intuitive idea of protocol competence by introducing a notion that considers, broadly speaking, an agent\u2019s ability to reach a particular state of the interaction and we provide preliminary results that allow us to automatically check competence in the context of a specific class of logic-based agents. Finally, we illustrate how these results can facilitate the customisation of protocols used by agents \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We present a novel negotiation model that allows an agent to learn how to negotiate during concurrent bilateral negotiations in unknown and dynamic e-markets. The agent uses an actor-critic architecture with model-free reinforcement learning to learn a strategy expressed as a deep neural network. We pre-train the strategy by supervision from synthetic market data, thereby decreasing the exploration time required for learning during negotiation. As a result, we can build automated agents for concurrent negotiations that can adapt to different e-market settings without the need to be pre-programmed. Our experimental evaluation shows that our deep reinforcement learning based agents outperform two existing well-known negotiation strategies in one-to-many concurrent bilateral negotiations for a range of e-market settings.",

Professor Sergot\u2019s scientific contributions range over many different fields. He has developed a series of novel ideas and formal methods bridging areas including artificial intelligence, computational logic, philosophical logic, legal theory, artificial intelligence and law, multi-agent systems and bioinformatics. By combining his background in logic and computing with his interest in the law, deontic logic, action, and related areas, and applying to all his capacity to understand the subtleties of social interaction and normative reasoning, Professor Sergot has opened up new directions of research, and has been a reference, an inspiration, and a model for many researchers in the fields to which he has contributed. The Festschrift includes several reminiscences and introductory essays describing Professor Sergot's achievements, followed by a series of articles on logic programming, temporal reasoning and action languages, artificial intelligence and law, deontic logic and norm-governed systems, and logical approaches to policies.",

To offer the envisioned run-time support we study selected versions of the Event Calculus to support efficient temporal reasoning without compromising the expressive power required to specify the norms. Both the knowledge representation framework and its associated infrastructure are highly configurable in the sense that they can be appropriately distributed in order to support real-time responses to agent requests. To exemplify the ideas, we apply the infrastructure on a benchmark scenario for multi-agent systems. Through experimental evaluation we also show how distributing our infrastructure can provide run-time support to large-scale multi-agent systems regulated by norms.",

            "Abstract": "Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used tools in statistics, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and scientific computation. However, despite their popularity, they can be difficult to apply; all but the simplest classification or regression applications require specification and inference over complex covariance functions that do not admit simple analytical posteriors. This paper shows how to embed Gaussian processes in any higher-order probabilistic programming language, using an idiom based on memoization, and demonstrates its utility by implementing and extending classic and state-of-the-art GP applications. The interface to Gaussian processes, called gpmem, takes an arbitrary real-valued computational process as input and returns a statistical emulator that automatically improve as the original process is invoked and its input-output behavior is recorded. The flexibility of gpmem is illustrated via three applications: (i) robust GP regression with hierarchical hyper-parameter learning, (ii) discovering symbolic expressions from time-series data by fully Bayesian structure learning over kernels generated by a stochastic grammar, and (iii) a bandit formulation of Bayesian optimization with automatic inference and action selection. All applications share a single 50-line Python library and require fewer than 20 lines of probabilistic code each.",

To tackle this problem, we take a multi-objective optimization stance, where the negotiating agent estimates the preferences of both user and opponent to generate bids that are (near) Pareto-optimal. However, since the negotiating agent needs to approximate the actual preferences of two parties, uncertainty is involved. To handle this uncertainty, we propose a fuzzy approach consisting of a two-phase Pareto-bid generation step where Phase-I generates the non-dominated solutions using a fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and Phase II ranks them to find the best bid to offer the opponent using a fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making method.

We are motivated by scenarios where location-independent smartservices provide the social and cognitive resources that agents will need to acquire in order to satisfy their users' needs.More concretely, we are investigating the situation where an agent who is trying to achieve a goal in a specific environment realises that it needs to join an artificial agent society in that environment (or possibly in another environment), which possesses the resources necessary for the agent to achieve the goal [14]. For example, if you travel to a foreign place for business purposes, you would expect your agent to join the artificial agent society of a train station, so that you can receive advice on how to buy a train ticket [5].",

Engineering for adaptation is particularly c-plicated when the distributed system itself is composed of autonomous entities that, on one hand, may act collaboratively and with benevolence, and, on the other, maybehavesel? shlywhilepursuingtheirowninterests. Still, theseentities have to coordinate themselves in order to adapt appropriately to the prevailing environmental conditions, and furthermore, to deliberate upon their own and the system\u2019s con? guration, and to be transparent to their users yet consistent with any human requirements. The question, therefore, of \u201chow to organize the envisagedadaptationforsuchautonomousentitiesinasystematicway\u201d becomes of paramount importance.

OAMAS was the steady convergence of a number of lines of research which suggested that such a workshop would be timely and opportune.

The architecture is a revised version of previous work with the KGP model [12, 23], which we specialise with knowledge about the agent\u2019s self, the negotiation opponents and the environment. Our work combines the specification of domain-independent decision-making with a new protocol for concurrent negotiation that revisits the well-known alternating offers protocol [22]. We show how the decision-making can be specialised to represent the agent\u2019s strategies, utilities and preferences using a Prolog-like meta-program. The work prepares the ground for supporting decision-making in concurrent bilateral negotiations that is more lightweight than previous work and contributes towards a fully developed model of the architecture.",

We show that attributes can be extracted from the time series produced by the Kinect sensor using a dynamic time-warping technique. The extracted attributes are then fed to a random forest algorithm, to recognise anomalous behaviour in time series of joint measurements over the whole movement. For comparison, the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm is also used on the same attributes with good results. Both methods\u2019 results are compared using Multi-Dimensional Scaling for clustering visualisation.",

            "Abstract": "We study the problem of task reallocation for load-balancing of MapReduce jobs in applications that process large datasets. In this context, we propose a novel strategy based on cooperative agents used to optimize the task scheduling in a single MapReduce job. The novelty of our strategy lies in the ability of agents to identify opportunities within a current unbalanced allocation, which in turn triggers concurrent and one-to-many negotiations amongst agents to locally reallocate some of the tasks within a job. Our contribution is that tasks are reallocated according to the proximity of the resources and they are performed in accordance to the capabilities of the nodes in which agents are situated. To evaluate the adaptivity and responsiveness of our approach, we implement a prototype test-bed and conduct a vast panel of experiments in a heterogeneous environment and by exploring varying hardware configurations \u2026",

The resulting framework is exemplified with an intuitive case, illustrating the importance of argumentation to develop models of cognitive agents with motivations.",

            "Abstract": "For the last two decades, agent-based technology has been applied to building intelligent systems. The ability of agents to make their own decisions and adapt to and learn from their environment is a very powerful tool for implementing intelligent systems of general competence. In addition, the study of multi-agent systems\u2014collections of specialised agents working in parallel\u2014has helped us to solve complex problems not previously solved using a centralised approach. Moreover, agent-based simulators have been used to better understand cooperation and competition in society. It is therefore not surprising that agent-based systems have been successful in many varied domains, including E-commerce, online learning, medicine, entertainment, human-computer interaction, business management, traffic control and conflict simulation. Because agent technology is such a key area of Artificial Intelligence, and as Britain is strongly represented in this area, the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour decided to make agent technology the theme of their 2001 convention (AISB\u201901), held in York. Five invited talks in the plenary sessions at AISB\u201901 were on agent-based topics. Nick Jennings discussed \u201cAutomated Haggling: Building Artificial Negotiators\u201d, Lyndon Lee described the \u201cMulti-Agent Research at British Telecom\u201d, Andrew Jones spoke \u201cOn the Concept of Trust\u201d, Christoph Benzm\u00fcller presented \u201cAn Agent Based Approach to Reasoning\u201d and Jim Doran described \u201cAgents and Ecosystem Management: from the Fraser River to Boolean Networks\u201d.

Apart from dividing the work through decentralization, we consider dynamicity because allocation of tasks must be concurrent with their execution, and adaptation because tasks must be reallocated when a disruptive event is performed. We will assume that agents are fully distributed and cooperative in order to optimize the global runtime, ie a systemcentric metric rather than user-centric metrics [10\u201313, 20, 24]. We will also assume that a task can be performed by any single agent without preemption and precedence order. Moreover, tasks have no deadlines, are indivisible and not shareable.We follow a market-based approach [10\u201313, 20, 24] to tackle the multi-agent situated task allocation problem. In order to improve load balancing, agents adopt a locality-based strategy in concurrent one-to-many negotiations for task delegations. The task reallocation is dynamic since the negotiation process is iterated and concurrent with the tasks processing. Moreover, the system is adaptive to disruptive events, eg task consumptions. As a practical application, we consider the distributed deployment of the MapReduce design pattern for processing large datasets [9]. Our preliminary empirical results show that, for such an application, the locality-based strategy improves the runtime.",

The motivation in this work is to utilise autonomous agent problemsolvers within a suitable multi-agent framework in such a way as to realise and generalise the capabilities of a DSS, while maintaining the DSS characteristic of significant user involvement. The approach taken is to employ agents both as domain problem solvers as well as to manage the interaction with the user as part of the semi-autonomous design. A framework for agent-enhanced DSS is presented which is more general than those presented previously. We show how the architectural framework used for KGP agents can be specialised to realise enhanced DSS capabilities.",

Although existing negotiation strategies offer a number of sophisticated features, including modelling an opponent and negotiating with many opponents simultaneously, they abstract away from the dynamicity of the market and the model that the agent holds for itself in terms of ongoing negotiations, thus ignoring information that increases an agent\u2019s utility. Our proposed strategy COncurrent Negotiating AgeNts (Conan) considers a weighted combination of modelling the market environment and the progress of concurrent negotiations in which the agent partakes. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the strategy\u2019s performance in various settings where different opponents from the literature provide a competitive market.

            "Abstract": "For the last two decades, agent-based technology has been applied to building intelligent systems. The ability of agents to make their own decisions and adapt to and learn from their environment is a very powerful tool for implementing intelligent systems of general competence. In addition, the study of multi-agent systems\u2014collections of specialised agents working in parallel\u2014has helped us to solve complex problems not previously solved using a centralised approach. Moreover, agent-based simulators have been used to better understand cooperation and competition in society. It is therefore not surprising that agent-based systems have been successful in many varied domains, including ecommerce, online learning, medicine, entertainment, human-computer interaction, business management, traffic control and conflict simulation. Because agent technology is such a key area of Artificial Intelligence, and as Britain is strongly represented in this area, the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour decided to make agent technology the theme of their 2001 convention (AISB\u201901), held in York. Five invited talks in the plenary sessions at AISB\u201901 were on agent-based topics. Nick Jennings discussed \u201cAutomated Haggling: Building Artificial Negotiators\u201d, Lyndon Lee described the \u201cMulti-Agent Research at British Telecom\u201d, Andrew Jones spoke \u201cOn the Concept of Trust\u201d, Christoph Benzm\u00fcller presented \u201cAn Agent Based Approach to Reasoning\u201d and Jim Doran described \u201cAgents and Ecosystem Management: from the Fraser River to Boolean Networks\u201d.

We then fuse the results, and last send the MA candidates to a k-nearest neighbors classifier for final assessment. The performance of the method, measured against 50 images with an ophthalmologist\u2019s hand-drawn ground-truth, shows high sensitivity (100%) and accuracy (84%), and running times around 10 s.

In close relationship to the declarative model, the computational model mirrors the logical architecture by specifying appropriate computational counterparts for the capabilities and using these to give the computational models of the transitions. These computational models and the one specified for the cycle theories are all based on, and are significant extensions of, existing proof procedures for abductive logic programming and logic \u2026",

We then define the process of generation of future states using these operators and an initial state and finally show the process by which the agent can use the generated states to form a policy with a standard reinforcement learning algorithm. The potential of SMART is exemplified using the well-known predator prey scenario. Results of applying SMART to this environment and directions for future work are discussed.",

The reuse part of MAGE relates physical actions that happen in an agent environment to count as valid moves of a game representing the social environment of an application. The coordination part of MAGE supports the construction of composite games built from component sub-games and corresponds to coordination patterns that support complex activities built from sub-activities.

We focus on allowing lightweight objects to not only share their capabilities with other objects but also to outsource capabilities when needed, in order to fulfil a user\u2019s goal. We exemplify our approach with a smart home scenario and a service-oriented implementation.",

            "Abstract": "We investigate the application of abductive logic programming, an existing framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, for specifying the knowledge and behaviour of software agents that need to access resources in a global computing environment. The framework allows agents that need resources to join artificial societies where those resources are available. We show how to endow agents with the capability of becoming and ceasing to be members of societies, for different categories of artificial agent societies, and of requesting and being given or denied resources within societies. The strength of our formulation lies in combining the modelling and the computational properties of abductive logic programming for dealing with the issues arising in resource access within artificial agent societies.",

Such an infrastructure uses a mobile application to monitor patients affected by GDM, whose parameters are then sent to and analysed by cognitive agents. We utilise a symbolic reasoning approach to formalise the events happening in the system, the entities participating in the interaction and the agent cognitive model for continuous monitoring of GDM. Such a cognitive model is based on deductive treatment adjustment rules to provide doctors with indications about the patient's treatment and on abductive rules to provide a diagnosis of the illness' current state. We evaluate our system by means of medical data to assess the precision of our infrastructure.",

            "Abstract": "We present a novel negotiation model that allows an agent to learn how to negotiate during concurrent bilateral negotiations in unknown and dynamic e-markets. The agent uses an actor-critic architecture with model-free reinforcement learning to learn a strategy expressed as a deep neural network. We pre-train the strategy by supervision from synthetic market data, thereby decreasing the exploration time required for learning during negotiation. As a result, we can build automated agents for concurrent negotiations that can adapt to different e-market settings without the need to be pre-programmed. Our experimental evaluation shows that our deep reinforcement learning-based agents outperform two existing well-known negotiation strategies in one-to-many concurrent bilateral negotiations for a range of e-market settings.",

But what if we wanted to use a machine learning algorithm to an IoT application so that it adapts intelligently to changes of the environment, or enable a software agent to enrich with artificial intelligence (AI) a smart home consisting of multiple and possibly incompatible technologies? In this work we answer these questions by studying a framework that explores how to simplify the incorporation of AI capabilities to existing sensor-actuator networks or IoT infrastructures making the services offered in such settings smarter. Towards this goal we present eVATAR+, a middleware that implements the interactions within the context \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We present a novel bilateral negotiation model that allows a self-interested agent to learn how to negotiate over multiple issues in the presence of user preference uncertainty. The model relies upon interpretable strategy templates representing the tactics the agent should employ during the negotiation and learns template parameters to maximize the average utility received over multiple negotiations, thus resulting in optimal bid acceptance and generation. Our model also uses deep reinforcement learning to evaluate threshold utility values, for those tactics that require them, thereby deriving optimal utilities for every environment state. To handle user preference uncertainty, the model relies on a stochastic search to find user model that best agrees with a given partial preference profile. Multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision-making methods are applied at negotiation time to generate Pareto-optimal outcomes thereby increasing the number of successful (win-win) negotiations. Rigorous experimental evaluations show that the agent employing our model outperforms the winning agents of the 10th Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC'19) in terms of individual as well as social-welfare utilities.",

We develop State-State Siamese Networks (S3N) as an efficient deep metric learning approach to AD in this context and explore how it may be used as part of an automated testing tool. Finally, we show by empirical evaluation on a series of Atari games, that S3N is able to learn a meaningful embedding, and consequently is able to identify various common types of video game bugs.",

An agent\u2019s strategy to maximize its utility in the marketplace is guided by its user\u2019s preferences and constraints such as \u2018maximum price\u2019 and \u2018deadline\u2019, as well as an agent\u2019s personality attributes, e.g., how \u2018eager\u2019 or \u2018late\u2019 the agent can be for exchanging goods and whether the agent is a \u2018spender\u2019 or \u2018saver\u2019 in an exchange.
