            "Abstract": "In this work we propose the design principles behind the development of a smart application utilized by mobile devices in order to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease that caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the deployment of this application utilizing their Bluetooth enabled devices, individuals may keep track of their close contacts, and if nearby contacts using the same application are reported later as infected the proximate individual is informed in order to be quarantined for a short of time, preventing hence the spread of the virus. Through the latest year, there have been developed several applications in the Google Play Store that can be deployed by smart devices utilizing their Bluetooth connectivity for the nearby device tracking. However, in this work we propose an open architecture for the development of such applications, that also incorporates a more elaborated graph-theoretic and algorithmic background regarding the contact tracing. The proposed contact tracing algorithm, that can be embedded in the deployment of the application, provides a more immediate tracking of the contacts of an infected individuals, providing a wider extent in the tracing of the contacts, leading hence to a more immediate mitigation of the epidemic.",

            "Abstract": "In this work we propose the design principles of a stochastic graph-based model for the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The proposed approach incorporates three sub-models, namely, the spatial model, the mobility model, and the propagation model, in order to develop a realistic environment for the study of the properties exhibited by the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The spatial model converts images of real cities taken from Google Maps into undirected weighted graphs that capture the spatial arrangement of the streets utilized next for the mobility of individuals. The mobility model implements a stochastic agent-based approach, developed in order to assign specific routes to individuals moving in the city, through the use of stochastic processes, utilizing the weights of the underlying graph to deploy shortest path algorithms. The propagation model implements both the epidemiological model and the physical substance of the transmission of an airborne virus considering the transmission parameters of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we integrate these sub-models in order to derive an integrated framework for the study of the epidemic dynamics exhibited through the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

A fundamental question that naturally poses itself for such common settings of heterogeneous distributed systems concerns their ability to preserve or restore an acceptable level of performance during link failures. In this work, we address this question for the specific case of stability properties of greedy, contention-resolution protocols operating over a packet-switched communication network that suffers from link slowdowns. We focus on the Adversarial Queueing Theory framework, where an adversary controls the rates of packet injections and determines packet paths. In addition, the power of the adversary is \u2026",

Motivated by the work of Uehara and Uno in [20], where they left the longest path problem open for the class of interval graphs, in this paper we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs. The proposed algorithm runs in O(n 4) time, where n is the number of vertices of the input graph, and bases on a dynamic programming approach.",

We provide an upper bound for the chromatic number \u03c7 (G), for any graph G, and show that G can be colinearly colored in polynomial time by proposing a simple algorithm. The colinear coloring of a graph G is a vertex coloring such that two vertices can be assigned the same color, if their corresponding clique sets are associated by the set inclusion relation (a clique set of a vertex u is the set of all maximal cliques containing u); the colinear chromatic number \u03bb (G) of G is the least integer k for which G admits a colinear coloring with k colors.

Moreover we give the first linear-time algorithm to decide whether a given graph belongs to the class of weakly quasi-threshold graphs, improving the previously known running time. Based on the simplicity of our recognition algorithm, we can provide certificates of membership (a structure that characterizes weakly quasi-threshold graphs) or non-membership (forbidden induced subgraphs) in additional  time.

Pulse pressure (PP) is independently related to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Strain and strain rate deformation parameters can detect subtle changes of the left ventricular (LV) function.Aim. To investigate the role of arterial stiffness in Systolic LV function and the effect of Pulse pressure in hypertension. Methods. We studied 55 consecutive hypertensive patients and 25 controls, matched for age (49.7\u00b15.7 vs. 45.5\u00b14.1 yrs), with normal EF (66\u00b12.5 vs. 64\u00b13.3%, NS). All subjects had 2D and colour doppler myocardial imaging of basal and mid LV segments (12) in the longitudinal axis. Mean longitudinal strain (S) and strain rate (SR) were averaged from each of the 12 segments assessed. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) carotid-femoral was used for estimation of arterial compliance in 20 of the hypertensive patients. Results. The hypertensive group had higher pulse pressure (59.5\u00b116.6 vs. 41.4\u00b17.2 mmHg, P< 0.001), and lower mean longitudinal S and SR (S: 18.1\u00b12.2 vs. 20.5\u00b12.0% P< 0.05 and SR: 1.34\u00b10.16 vs. 1.54\u00b10.13/s P< 0.05) compared to control.

In this work we conduct the first systematic study that reveals graph families for which the optimal solutions for MaxSTC and Cluster Deletion coincide.

Recent studies have suggested that a large variety of complex processes, including earthquakes, heartbeats, and neuronal dynamics, exhibits statistical similarities. Here we are studying in terms of complexity and non linear techniques whether isomorphic signatures emerged indicating the transition from the normal state to the both geological and biological shocks. In the last 15 years, the study of Complex Systems has emerged as a recognized field in its own right, although a good definition of what a complex system is, actually is eluded. A basic reason for our interest in complexity is the striking similarity in behaviour close to irreversible phase transitions among systems that are otherwise quite different in nature. It is by now recognized that the pre-seismic electromagnetic time-series contain valuable information about the earthquake preparation process, which cannot be extracted without the use of important computational power, probably in connection with computer Algebra techniques. This paper presents an analysis, the aim of which is to indicate the approach of the global instability in the pre-focal area. Non-linear characteristics are studied by applying two techniques, namely the Correlation Dimension Estimation and the Approximate Entropy.

Our system uses an efficient technique for watermarking images by exploiting certain properties of a specific 2D representation of permutations, it has a friendly graphical user interface and shows interesting performance figures. The system provides students with two main working levels:(I) the student creates a secret key, ie, the watermark, and embeds it into his own image, and (II) he makes the marks of a watermarked image visible in order to later extract the watermark from it using only, for pedagogical reasons, a ruler and a pencil. The watermarking method behind WaterIP can be applied to all educational levels beginning from early childhood up to preliminary and high schools. We demonstrate the educational effectiveness of our WaterIP system by presenting ways of how it can be applied in class and show that WaterIP helps to understand what intellectual property rights really stand for.",

In spite of available drug and surgical treatment options, more than 25% of individuals with epilepsy have seizures that are uncontrollable. For these patients with intractable epilepsy, the unpredictability of seizure occurrence underlies an enhanced risk of sudden unexpected death or morbidity. Therefore, a device that could predict a seizure and notify the patient of the impending event or trigger an antiepileptic device would dramatically increase the quality of life for those patients. Here, a patient-specific classification algorithm is proposed to distinguish between preictal and interictal features extracted from ECG-EEG recordings.

            "Abstract": " When a heterogeneous material is strained, its evolution toward breaking is characterized by the nucleation and the coalescence of micro-cracks before the final break-up. Electromagnetic (EM) emission in a wide frequency spectrum ranging from very low frequencies (VLF) to very high frequencies (VHF) is produced by micro-cracks, which can be considered as the so-called precursors of general fracture. Herein we consider earthquakes (EQs) as large-scale fracture phenomena. We study the capability of nonlinear time series analysis to extract features from pre-seismic electromagnetic (EM) activity possibly indicating the nucleation of the impending EQ. In particular, we want to quantify and to visualize temporal changes of the complexity into consecutive time-windows of the time series. In this direction the original continuous time EM data is projected to a linguistic symbolic sequence and then we calculate the block entropies of the optimal partition. This analysis reveals a significant reduction of complexity of the underlying fracto-electromagnetic mechanism as the catastrophic events is approaching. We verify this result in terms of correlation dimension analysis. We point out that these findings are compatible with results from an independent linear method which uses a wavelet based approach for the estimation of fractal spectral characteristics. Field and laboratory experiments associate the epoch of low complexity in the tail of the precursory emission with the nucleation phase of the impending earthquake.",

The approach proposed here introduces a new use of prediction and approximation methods for the differentiation between healthy and unhealthy subjects. Local linear prediction and least squares approximation, though common in signal analysis, have yet to be applied as a cardiogram categorization tool. We show that measuring the error of both methods, as they are applied to each cardiogram, results in a clear distinction between the two groups. This is in coherence with cardiac physiology, since the behavior of a healthy subject ECG is more erratic than an unhealthy subject's.",

Moreover, unlike previous linear co-connectivity algorithms, this algorithm admits efficient parallelization, leading to an optimal O(log n)-time and O((n+m)log n)-processor algorithm on the EREW PRAM model of computation. It is worth noting that, for the related problem of computing the connected components of a graph, no optimal deterministic parallel algorithm is currently available. The co-connectivity algorithms find applications in a number of problems.

It takes as input a hypercube Qn with N=2n nodes and runs in O(NlogN) time. Based on the labeling algorithm we propose a recognition algorithm for hypercubes which runs in O(NlogN) time.

Given a graph G and a subset T of k vertices of V (G), a k-fixed-endpoint path cover of G with respect to T is a set of vertex-disjoint paths P that covers the vertices of G such that the k vertices of T are all endpoints of the paths in P. The kPC problem is to find a k-fixed-endpoint path cover of G of minimum cardinality; note that, if T is empty (or, equivalently, k= 0), the stated problem coincides with the classical path cover problem. The kPC problem generalizes some path cover related problems, such as the 1HP and 2HP problems, which have been proved to be NP-complete. Note that the complexity status for both 1HP and 2HP problems on interval graphs remains an open question (Damaschke (1993)[9]).

Recently, along with the high usage of distributed systems and the increasing speed in telecommunications, the early detection of malware constitutes one of the major concerns in information society. A strong advantage that malware employs in order to elude detection is the ability of polymorphism (metamorphic or polymorphic engines). In this work we present efficient algorithmic techniques that, leveraging higher level abstractions of malware structure, perform an isomorphism check in malware's produced graph structures, such as function call-graphs and control flow-graphs, in order to detect every possible polymorphic version of a malware. Moreover, we propose an algorithmic approach for malware detection which focuses on the use of behavioural graphs as a more flexible representation of malware's functionality with respect to its interaction with the operating system. The main idea of our approach is mainly based on behavioural graph similarity issues.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present an algorithm for determining the number of spanning trees of a graph G which takes advantage of the structure of the modular decomposition tree of G. Specifically, our algorithm works by contracting the modular decomposition tree of the input graph G in a bottom-up fashion until it becomes a single node; then, the number of spanning trees of G is computed as the product of a collection of values which are associated with the vertices of G and are updated during the contraction process. In particular, when applied on a (q, q\u2212 4)-graph for fixed q, a P 4-tidy graph, or a tree-cograph, our algorithm computes the number of its spanning trees in time linear in the size of the graph, where the complexity of arithmetic operations is measured under the uniform-cost criterion. Therefore we give the first linear-time algorithm for the counting problem in the considered graph classes.",

The motivation for this problem comes from algorithms for the dynamic recognition and online maintenance of graphs; the proposed algorithm could be a suitable addition to the algorithm of Shamir and Sharan [13] for the online maintenance of cographs. The proposed algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the input graph and requires linear space.",

In this paper we propose an efficient method for encoding the same watermark value into several different graphs, we call it multiple encoding, answering thus the question we have recently left open. In particular, we propose an efficient algorithm which embed a cograph G [\u03c0*] into a reducible permutation graph F [\u03c0*] by first computing the cotree of G [\u03c0*] then computing a rooted binary tree having specific node-value and child-parent properties, and finally, based on these properties, producing a reducible permutation graph F [\u03c0*].

In particular, we prove properties and show that we can produce bipolarizable and P 4-simplicial orderings on the vertices of a graph G, if such orderings exist, working only on P 3s that participate in P 4s of G. The proposed recognition algorithms are simple, use simple data structures and require O(n+m) space.

We provide an upper bound for the chromatic number \u03c7(G), for any graph G, and show that G can be colinearly colored in polynomial time by proposing a simple algorithm. The colinear coloring of a graph G is a vertex coloring such that two vertices can be assigned the same color, if their corresponding clique sets are associated by the set inclusion relation (a clique set of a vertex u is the set of all maximal cliques containing u); the colinear chromatic number \u03bb(G) of G is the least integer k for which G admits a colinear coloring with k colors. Based on the colinear coloring, we define the \u03c7-colinear and \u03b1-colinear properties and characterize known graph classes in terms of these properties.",

The value of each sample point is predicted using the values of k previous samples and the prediction error is computed. Since high variability of the heart signal indicates normal cardiac function, it is expected that the prediction errors of signals acquired from healthy subjects would present larger values than those of subjects with some sort of cardiac pathology. This is indeed the case, as is confirmed by the results shown here. Several prediction techniques have been applied, all of which lead to similar experimental results showing a clear distinction between the two groups of subjects.",

More precisely, given an initial infected population (mobile devices), we establish upper bounds on the time needed for a counter-measure to take effect after infection (response-time), in order to prevent a malware pandemic. Thus, within a period of time, we guarantee that not all the susceptible devices in the city get infected and some (or, all) infected ones get sanitized. In our work, we first propose a malware propagation model along with a device mobility model and then, utilizing these models, we develop a simulator that we use to study the spread of malware in such networks. Finally, we provide experimental results for the pandemic prevention taken by our simulator \u2026",

As a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem, it is NP-complete on general graphs and, in fact, on every class of graphs that the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete. Polynomial solutions for the longest path problem have recently been proposed for weighted trees, ptolemaic graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, interval graphs, and some small classes of graphs. Although the Hamiltonian path problem on cocomparability graphs was proved to be polynomial almost two decades ago[9], the complexity status of the longest path problem on cocomparability graphs has remained open until now; actually, the complexity status of the problem has remained open even on the smaller class of permutation graphs. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the longest path problem on the class \u2026",

Based on the structure of the cent-tree, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a (2T-graph to be Hamiltonian. By taking advantage of these properties and conditions, we construct linear-time algorithms for finding a Hamiltonian cycle and computing the Hamiltonian completion number and the Hamiltonian completion edge set in a QT-graph; our algorithms take O (n+ m) time on graphs with n vertices and m edges. This implies linear-time recognition algorithms for this class of graphs. We also present a linear-time algorithm for constructing the cent-tree of a (2T-graph.",

We study the spanning tree behaviour of the sequence {Kn\u2212Gn} when n\u2192\u221e and the number of edges of Gn scales according to n. More specifically, we define the spanning tree indicator \u03b1({Gn}), a quantity that characterizes the spanning tree behaviour of {Kn\u2212Gn}. We derive closed formulas for the spanning tree indicators for certain well-known classes of graphs. Finally, we demonstrate that the indicator can be used to compare the spanning tree behaviour of different classes of graphs (even when their members never happen to have the same number of edges).",

            "Abstract": "In this work we propose a graph-based model that, utilizing relations between groups of System-calls, distinguishes malicious from benign software samples and classifies the detected malicious samples to one of a set of known malware families. More precisely, given a System-call Dependency Graph (ScDG) that depicts the malware's behavior, we first transform it to a more abstract representation, utilizing the indexing of System-calls to a set of groups of similar functionality, constructing thus an abstract and mutation-tolerant graph that we call Group Relation Graph (GrG); then, we construct another graph representation, which we call Coverage Graph (CvG), that depicts the dominating relations between the nodes of a GrG graph. Based on the research so far in the field, we pointed out that behavior-based graph representations had not leveraged the aspect of the temporal evolution of the graph. Hence, the novelty of our work is that, preserving the initial representations of GrG and CvG graphs, we focus on augmenting the potentials of theses graphs by adding further features that enhance its abilities on detecting and further classifying to a known malware family an unknown malware sample. To that end, we construct periodical instances of the graph that represent its temporal evolution concerning its structural modifications, creating another graph representation that we call Temporal Graphs. In this paper, we present the theoretical background behind our approach, discuss the current technological status on malware detection and classification and demonstrate the overall architecture of our proposed detection and classification model \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this work we propose efficient codec algorithms for watermarking images that are intended for uploading on the web under intellectual property protection. Headed to this direction, we recently suggested a way in which an integer number w which being transformed into a self-inverting permutation, can be represented in a two dimensional (2D) object and thus, since images are 2D structures, we have proposed a watermarking algorithm that embeds marks on them using the 2D representation of w in the spatial domain. Based on the idea behind this technique, we now expand the usage of this concept by marking the image in the frequency domain. In particular, we propose a watermarking technique that also uses the 2D representation of self-inverting permutations and utilizes marking at specific areas thanks to partial modifications of the image\u2019s Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Those modifications are made on the magnitude of specific frequency bands and they are the least possible additive information ensuring robustness and imperceptiveness. We have experimentally evaluated our algorithms using various images of different characteristics under JPEG compression. The experimental results show an improvement in comparison to the previously obtained results and they also depict the validity of our proposed codec algorithms.",

Science 290 (2003) 1541\u20131556] presented a time-and work-optimal algorithm for finding the smallest number of vertex-disjoint paths that cover the vertices of a cograph and left open the problem of applying their technique into other classes of graphs. Motivated by this issue we generalize their technique and apply it to the class of P 4-sparse graphs, which forms a proper superclass of cographs. We show that the path cover problem on P 4-sparse graphs can also be optimally solved. More precisely, given a P 4-sparse graph G on n vertices and its modular decomposition tree, we describe an optimal parallel algorithm which returns a minimum path cover of G in O (log n) time using O (n/log n) processors on the EREW PRAM model. Our results generalize previous results and extend the family of perfect graphs admitting \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is an established measure for cardiac health. Its use is widespread and many methods have been developed for its analysis. Little emphasis, however, has been given to the specific influence of noise from the electrocardiogram (ECG) on the heart rate (HR) series. There are explicit factors of noise that have been extensively studied on the ECG and much work has been published on their limitation or elimination. Despite all these solutions, however, often noise does end up in the ECG and is inevitably included in the derived HR series. It is of interest to investigate how this influences subsequent HRV analysis. We propose that the noise into the resulting HR series: Shifted R-peak (white noise) and false peaks. In this paper, we demonstrate how these two scenarios affect the outcome of the HRV analysis.",

We present experimental results using different wavelet families showing that the Haar wavelet is the most appropriate wavelet to use for heartbeat timeseries. Next, we apply several metrics on the detail wavelet coefficients and show that the diagnostic capability of each one of those metrics may vary from scale to scale. The selection of a different metric for each scale of analysis leads to better categorization performance.",

Our approach relies on maintaining the modular decomposition tree of the graph, which we use for solving the recognition problem. We establish properties for each modification to yield a P 4-sparse graph and obtain a fully dynamic recognition algorithm which handles edge modifications in O (1) time and vertex modifications in O (d) time for a vertex of degree d. Thus, our algorithm implies an optimal edges-only dynamic algorithm and a new optimal incremental algorithm for P 4-sparse graphs.",

            "Abstract": "Software watermarking involves embedding a unique identifier or, equivalently, a watermark value within a software to prove owner's authenticity and thus to prevent or discourage copyright infringement. Towards the embedding process, several graph theoretic watermarking algorithmic techniques encode the watermark values as graph structures and embed them in application programs. Recently, we presented an efficient codec system for encoding a watermark number  as a reducible permutation graph  through the use of self-inverting permutations . In this paper, we propose a dynamic watermarking model, which we call WaterRPG, for embedding the watermark graph  into an application program . The main idea behind the proposed watermarking model is a systematic use of appropriate calls of specific functions of the program . More precisely, for a specific input  of the program , our model takes the dynamic call-graph  of  and the watermark graph , and produces the watermarked program  having the following key property: its dynamic call-graph  is isomorphic to the watermark graph . Within this idea the program  is produced by only altering appropriate calls of specific functions of the input application program . We have implemented our watermarking model WaterRPG in real application programs and evaluated its functionality under various and broadly used watermarking assessment criteria. The evaluation results show that our model efficiently watermarks Java application programs with respect to several watermarking metrics like data-rate, bytecode instructions overhead \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present a graph-based framework that, utilizing relations between groups of System-calls, detects whether an unknown software sample is malicious or benign, and classifies a malicious software to one of a set of known malware families. In our approach we propose a novel graph representation of dependency graphs by capturing their structural evolution over time constructing sequential graph instances, the so-called Temporal Graphs. The partitions of the temporal evolution of a graph defined by specific time-slots, results to different types of graphs representations based upon the information we capture across the capturing of its evolution. The proposed graph-based framework utilizes the proposed types of temporal graphs computing similarity metrics over various graph characteristics in order to conduct the malware detection and classification procedures. Finally, we evaluate the detection \u2026",

            "Abstract": "A series of significant surface earthquakes (EQs) occurred recently, ie, during 2008 and 2009, on land or near coast-line in Greece. Clear MHz-kHz electromagnetic (EM) anomalies have been systematically detected over periods ranging from a few days to a few hours prior to these recent EQs, with the MHz radiation appearing earlier than the kHz. A multidisciplinary analysis in terms of fault modelling, laboratory experiments, scaling similarities of multiple fracturing of solid materials, fractal electrodynamics, criticality, universality, fractal spectral analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis, and complexity, validates the association of the detected pre-seismic EM emissions with the fracturing process in the focal area of the impending EQ. We underline that the extracted results are in harmony with previous ones supporting the consideration that the kHz part could be due to the fracture of the backbone of large asperities \u2026",

In this work, we study this question in the context of Adversarial Queueing Theory which assumes that an adversary controls the locations and rates of packet injections and determines packet paths. Within this framework, we present optimal algorithms for detecting the universal stability (packet paths do not contain repeated edges but may contain repeated vertices) and the simple-path universal stability (paths contain neither repeated vertices nor repeated edges) of a network.

Following up on our recently proposed methods for encoding watermark numbers  as reducible permutation flow-graphs  through the use of self-inverting permutations , in this paper, we extend the types of flow-graphs available for software watermarking by proposing two different reducible permutation flow-graphs  and  incorporating important properties which are derived from the bitonic subsequences composing the self-inverting permutation . We show that a self-inverting permutation  can be efficiently encoded into either  or  and also efficiently decoded from theses graph structures.

Towards this direction, a significant number of watermarking techniques have been proposed in recent years in order to create robust and imperceptible audio watermarks. In this work we propose an audio watermarking technique which efficiently and secretly embeds information, or equivalently watermarks, into an audio digital signal. Our technique is based on the main idea of a recently proposed image watermarking technique expanding thus the digital objects that can be efficiently watermarked through the use of self-inverting permutations. More precisely, our audio watermarking technique uses the 1D representation of self-inverting permutations and utilizes marking at specific areas thanks to partial modifications of the audio\u2019s Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT); these modifications are made on the magnitude of specific frequency bands. We have evaluated the embedding and extracting algorithms by testing them on various and different in characteristics audio signals that were in WAV format and we have obtained positive results.

Recent studies have suggested that a large variety of complex processes, including earthquakes, heartbeats, and neuronal dynamics, exhibits statistical similarities. Here we are studying in terms of complexity and non linear techniques whether isomorphic signatures emerged indicating the transition from the normal state to the both geological and biological shocks. In the last 15 years, the study of Complex Systems has emerged as a recognized field in its own right, although a good definition of what a complex system is, actually is eluded. A basic reason for our interest in complexity is the striking similarity in behaviour close to irreversible phase transitions among systems that are otherwise quite different in nature. It is by now recognized that the pre-seismic electromagnetic time-series contain valuable information about the earthquake preparation process, which cannot be extracted without the use of important computational power, probably in connection with computer Algebra techniques. This paper presents an analysis, the aim of which is to indicate the approach of the global instability in the prefocal area. Non-linear characteristics are studied by applying two techniques, namely the Correlation Dimension Estimation and the Approximate Entropy.",

In this paper, we implement our watermarking model WaterRpg in real application programs, taken from a game database, and evaluate its functionality under various watermarking issues supported by our WaterRpg model. More precisely, we selected a number of Java application programs and watermark them using two main approaches. First, we show in detail a straightforward or naive approach for watermarking a given program P which is based only on the well-defined call patterns of our model, and then we prove structural and programming properties of the call patterns based on \u2026",

More precisely, we utilize the System-call Dependency Graphs (or, for short, ScD-graphs), obtained by traces captured through dynamic taint analysis. We design our model to be resistant against strong mutations applying our detection and classification techniques on a weighted directed graph, namely Group Relation Graph, or Gr-graph for short, resulting from ScD-graph after grouping disjoint subsets of its vertices. For the detection process, we propose the -similarity metric, and for the process of classification, we propose the SaMe-similarity and NP-similarity metrics consisting the SaMe-NP similarity.

In this context, one can search for signatures that imply the transition from a normal state to a main catastrophic event (eg, earthquake). Experimental techniques are thus useful in corroborating theories from observed data. For example, recent results indicate that preseismic electromagnetic time series contain information characteristic of an ensuing earthquake event. Hereby, we attempt to demonstrate that an easily computable complexity measure, such as T-complexity or approximate entropy, gives evidence of state changes leading to the point of global instability. The appearance of a precatastrophic state is characterized by significant lower complexity in terms of T-complexity and approximate entropy. The present study confirms the conclusions of previous works based on an independent \u2026",

We study the problem of coloring permutation graphs using certain properties of the lattice representation of a permutation and relationships between permutations, directed acyclic graphs and rooted trees having specific key properties. We propose an efficient parallel algorithm which colors an n-node permutation graph in O (log 2 n) time using O (n 2/log n) processors on the CREW PRAM model. Specifically, given a permutation \u03c0 we construct a tree T\u2217[\u03c0], which we call coloring-permutation tree, using certain combinatorial properties of \u03c0. We show that the problem of coloring a permutation graph is equivalent to finding vertex levels in the coloring-permutation tree.",

In this paper, we consider the recognition problem on these classes of graphs and present algorithms that solve it in O(n m) time. In particular, we prove properties and show that we can produce bipolarizable and P_4-simplicial orderings on the vertices of the input graph G, if such orderings exist, working only on P_3s that participate in a P_4 of G. The proposed recognition algorithms are simple, use simple data structures and both require O(n + m) space. Additionally, we show how our recognition algorithms can be augmented to provide certificates, whenever they decide that G is not bipolarizable or P_4-simplicial; the augmentation takes O(n + m) time and space. Finally, we include a diagram on class inclusions and the currently best recognition time complexities for a number of perfectly orderable classes of graphs.",

            "Abstract": "Motivated by the definition of linear coloring on simplicial complexes, recently introduced in the context of algebraic topology \\cite{Civan}, and the framework through which it was studied, we introduce the linear coloring on graphs. We provide an upper bound for the chromatic number , for any graph , and show that  can be linearly colored in polynomial time by proposing a simple linear coloring algorithm. Based on these results, we define a new class of perfect graphs, which we call co-linear graphs, and study their complement graphs, namely linear graphs. The linear coloring of a graph  is a vertex coloring such that two vertices can be assigned the same color, if their corresponding clique sets are associated by the set inclusion relation (a clique set of a vertex  is the set of all maximal cliques containing ); the linear chromatic number  of  is the least integer  for which  admits a linear coloring with  colors. We show that linear graphs are those graphs  for which the linear chromatic number achieves its theoretical lower bound in every induced subgraph of . We prove inclusion relations between these two classes of graphs and other subclasses of chordal and co-chordal graphs, and also study the structure of the forbidden induced subgraphs of the class of linear graphs.",

We classify the edges of an undirected graph as either free, semi-free or actual, and define the class of A-free graphs as the class containing all the graphs with no actual edges. Then, we define the actual subgraph G a of a non-A-free graph G as the subgraph containing all the actual edges of G. We show properties and characterizations for the class of A-free graphs and the actual subgraph G a of a cograph G, and use them to derive structural and recognition properties for cographs and threshold graphs. These properties imply parallel recognition algorithms which run in O (1) time using O (nm) processors.",

The main idea behind the proposed watermarking model is to modify the dynamic call-graph G (P, I key) of the program P, taken by the specific input I key, so that the dynamic call-graph G (P*, I key) of the resulting watermarked program P* and the the reducible permutation graph F [\u03c0*] are isomorphic; within this idea the program P* is produced by only altering appropriate calls of specific functions of the input application program P. Our model belongs to execution trace watermarks category. In this paper, we implement our WaterRpg watermarking model on several Java application programs and evaluate it under various criteria in order to gain information about its practical behavior.

Until now, seizures cannot be predicted with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Most of the seizure prediction studies have been focused on a small number of patients, and frequently assuming unrealistic hypothesis. This paper adopts the view that for an appropriate development of reliable predictors one should consider long-term recordings and several features and algorithms integrated in one software tool. A computational environment, based on Matlab  \u00ae , is presented, aiming to be an innovative tool for seizure prediction. It results from the need of a powerful and flexible tool for long-term EEG/ECG analysis by multiple features and algorithms. After being extracted, features can be subjected to several reduction and selection methods, and then used for prediction. The predictions can be conducted based on optimized \u2026",

To gain insight into the performance of the proposed event set algorithms and allow comparisons with the other selected algorithms, they are tested under a wide variety of conditions in an experimental way.

More precisely, we utilize the system-call dependency graphs (or, for short ScD graphs), obtained by capturing taint analysis traces and a set of various similarity metrics in order to detect whether an unknown test sample is a malicious or a benign one. For the sake of generalization, we decide to empower our model against strong mutations by applying our detection technique on a weighted directed graph resulting from ScD graph after grouping disjoint subsets of its vertices. Additionally, we have developed a similarity metric, which we call NP-similarity, that combines qualitative, quantitative, and relational characteristics that are spread among the members of known malware families to archives a clear distinction between graph-representations of malware and the ones of benign software. Finally, we evaluate our detection model and compare our results against the results achieved by a variety of techniques proving the potentials of our model.",

Block Entropy analysis is applied to these dynamics in order to examine its coarse-grained statistics. Our data set is comprised of two subsets, one of healthy subjects and another of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients. It is found that Entropy analysis provides a quick and efficient tool for the differentiation of these series according to subject category.

More precisely, given a System-call Dependency Graph (ScDG) that depicts the malware's behavior, we first transform it to a more abstract representation, utilizing the indexing of System-calls to a set of groups of similar functionality, constructing thus a mutation tolerant graph that we call Group Relation Graph (GrG); we pointed out that behavior-based graph representations had not leveraged the aspect of the temporal evolution of the graph. Hence, the novelty of our work is that, preserving the initial representations of GrG graphs, we focus on augmenting the potentials of theses graphs by adding further features that enhance its detection abilities.

Faster algorithms have recently been presented by Raschle and Simon and by Nikolopoulos and Palios; the time complexity of both algorithms is O(n + m 2), where m is the number of edges of the graph. In this paper, we describe an O(nm)-time, O(n+m)-space algorithm for the recognition of P4-comparability graphs. The algorithm computes the P 4s of the input graph G by means of the BFS-trees of the complement of G rooted at each of its vertices, without however explicitly computing the complement of G.

Our codec algorithms are very simple, use elementary operations on sequences and linked structures, and the produced flow-graph F [\u03c0\u2217] does not differ from the graph data structures built by real programs. Moreover, our codec algorithms have very low time and space complexity and the flow-graph F [\u03c0\u2217] incorporates important structural properties which cause it resilient to attacks. We have evaluated several components of our codec system in a simulation environment in order to obtain a clear view of their practical behaviour; the experimental results show that we can decide with high probability whether the graph F [\u03c0\u2217] suffer an attack on its edges.",

Specifically, our algorithm works by contracting the modular decomposition tree of the input graph G in a bottom-up fashion until it becomes a single node; then, the number of spanning trees of G is computed as the product of a collection of values which are associated with the vertices of G and are updated during the contraction process. In particular, when applied on a (q,q\u2009\u2212\u20094)-graph for fixed q, a P 4-tidy graph, or a tree-cograph, our algorithm computes the number of its spanning trees in time linear in the size of the graph, where the complexity of arithmetic operations is measured under the uniform-cost criterion. Therefore we give the first linear-time algorithm for the counting problem in the considered graph classes.",

We establish conditions for each modification to yield a P 4-sparse graph and obtain a fully dynamic recognition algorithm which handles edge modifications in O(1) time and vertex modifications in O(d) time for a vertex of degree d.

            "Abstract": "Digital watermarking involves embedding a watermark value within a digital object, such as image, audio, video, text and software, to prove authenticity in case of intellectual property infringement. Headed to this direction, in this paper we survey our previous algorithmic techniques for software and image watermarking and present a new developing idea based on them for audio watermarking. Our watermarking techniques take as an input a watermark that is an integer  which can be efficiently encoded as a self-inverting permutation . We demonstrate multiple representations of self-inverting permutations, namely reducible permutation graphs, two-dimensional and one-dimensional matrices. We propose efficient algorithmic techniques for watermarking software, image and audio that exploit self-inverting permutation representations in order to embed the watermark  by making imperceptible modifications and producing equivalent watermarked objects of high fidelity.",

We also study the k-path partition problem and, motivated by a recent work of Steiner [G. Steiner, On the k-path partition of graphs, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 290 (2003) 2147\u20132155], where he left the problem open for the class of convex graphs, we prove that the k-path partition problem is NP-complete on convex graphs. Moreover, we study the complexity of these problems on two well-known subclasses of chordal graphs namely quasi-threshold and threshold graphs. Based on the work of Bodlaender [HL Bodlaender, Achromatic number is NP-complete for cographs and interval graphs, Inform. Process. Lett. 31 (1989) 135\u2013138], we show NP-completeness \u2026",

Specifically, we show that a P 4-sparse graph G on n vertices and m edges has fewer than 2 n/3 minimal separators of total description size at most 4 m/3. The bound on the number of minimal separators is tight and is also tight for the class of cographs, a well known subclass of the P 4-sparse graphs. Our results enable us to present a linear-time and linear-space algorithm for computing the number of minimal separators of a given P 4-sparse graph; the algorithm can be modified to report the minimal separators of the input graph in linear time and space as well.",

            "Abstract": " Ultra low frequency-ULF (1 Hz or lower), kHz and MHz electromagnetic (EM) anomalies were recorded prior to the L'Aquila catastrophic earthquake (EQ) that occurred on 6 April 2009. The detected anomalies followed this temporal scheme. (i) The MHz EM anomalies were detected on 26 March 2009 and 2 April 2009. The kHz EM anomalies were emerged on 4 April 2009. The ULF EM anomaly was appeared from 29 March 2009 up to 3 April 2009. The question effortlessly arises as to whether the observed anomalies before the L'Aquila EQ were seismogenic or not. The main goal of this work is to provide some insight into this issue. More precisely, the main aims of this contribution are threefold: How can we recognize an EM observation as pre-seismic one? We aim, through a multidisciplinary analysis to provide some elements of a definition. How can we link an individual EM anomaly with a distinctive stage of the EQ preparation process? The present analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that the kHz EM anomalies were associated with the fracture of asperities that were distributed along the L'Aquila fault sustaining the system, while the MHz EM anomalies could be triggered by fractures in the highly disordered system that surrounded the backbone of asperities of the activated fault. How can we identify precursory symptoms in an individual EM precursor that indicate that the occurrence of the EQ is unavoidable? We clearly state that the detection of a MHz EM precursor does not mean that the occurrence of EQ is unavoidable; the abrupt emergence of kHz EM emissions indicate the fracture of asperities.

The key element of the algorithms is the use of the depth-first-search traversal on appropriate auxiliary graphs in which moving between any two adjacent vertices is equivalent to walking along a P4 (i.e., a chordless path on four vertices) of the input graph or on its complement, respectively. The approach can be generalized so that for a fixed constant k \u2265 5 we obtain an O(nk-1)-time algorithm for the detection of a hole (antihole resp.) on at least k vertices.

We also show that determining whether the complement \u00f8verlineG of the graph G is HH-free can be efficiently resolved in O(n m) time using O(n^2) space, which leads to an O(n m)-time and O(n^2)-space algorithm for recognizing WPO-graphs.

            "Abstract": "A distinguishing feature of today\u2019s large-scale communication networks, such as the Internet, is their heterogeneity, predominantly manifested by the fact that a wide variety of communication protocols are simultaneously running over different network hosts. A fundamental question that naturally poses itself for such common settings of heterogeneous networks concerns their ability to preserve the number of packets in the system upper bounded at all times. This property is well-known as stability. We focus on the Adversarial Queueing Theory framework, where an adversary controls the rates of packet injections and determines packet paths. In this work, we present specific network constructions with different protocol compositions and we show experimentally their stability behavior under an adversarilly strategy. In particular, we study compositions of universally stable protocols with unstable protocols like \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We prove algorithmic characterizations of weakly chordal graphs, which lead to efficient parallel algorithms for recognizing P5-free and -free weakly chordal graphs. For an input graph on n vertices and m edges, our algorithms run in O(log2n) time and require O(m2/log n) processors on the EREW PRAM model of computation. The proposed recognition algorithms efficiently detect P5s and  in weakly chordal graphs in O(log n) time with O(m2/logn) processors on the EREW PRAM. Additionally, we show how the algorithms can be augmented to provide a certificate for the existence of a P5 (or a ) in case the input graph is not P5-free (respectively, -free) weakly chordal.",

            "Abstract": "The longest path problem is the problem of finding a path of maximum length in a graph. Polynomial solutions for this problem are known only for small classes of graphs, while it is NP-hard on general graphs, as it is a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem. Motivated by the work of Uehara and Uno (Proc. of the 15th Annual International Symp. on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), LNCS, vol. 3341, pp. 871\u2013883, 2004), where they left the longest path problem open for the class of interval graphs, in this paper we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs. The proposed algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach and runs in O(n 4) time, where n is the number of vertices of the input graph.",

            "Abstract": "Epilepsy, a neurological disorder in which patients suffer from recurring seizures, affects approximately 1% of the world population. In spite of available drug and surgical treatment options, more than 25% of individuals with epilepsy have seizures that are uncontrollable. For these patients with intractable epilepsy, the unpredictability of seizure occurrence underlies an enhanced risk of sudden unexpected death or morbidity. A system that could warn the patient of the impending event or trigger an antiepileptic device would dramatically increase the quality of life for those patients. Here, we proposed a patient-specific algorithm for possible seizure warning using machine learning classification of 34 algorithmic features derived from EEG\u2013ECG recordings. We evaluated our algorithm on unselected and continuous recordings of 12 patients (total of 108 seizures and 3178-h). Good out-of-sample performances were \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we study the problems of detecting holes and antiholes in general undirected graphs and present algorithms for them, which, for a graph on n vertices and m edges, run in O (n+ m2) time and require O (nm) space; we thus provide a solution to the open problem posed by Hayward, Spinrad, and Sritharan in [12] asking for an O (n4)-time algorithm for finding holes in arbitrary graphs. The key element of the algorithms is a special type of depthfirst search traversal which proceeds along P4s (ie, chordless paths on four vertices) of the input graph. We also describe a different approach which allows us to detect antiholes in graphs that do not contain chordless cycles on 5 vertices in O (n+ m2) time requiring O (n+ m) space. Our algorithms are simple and can be easily used in practice. Additionally, we show how our detection algorithms can be augmented so that they return a hole or an antihole whenever such a structure is detected in the input graph; the augmentation takes O (n+ m) time and space.",

            "Abstract": "The K_n-complement of a graph G, denoted by K_n-G, is defined as the graph obtained from the complete graph K_n by removing a set of edges that span G; if G has n vertices, then K_n-G coincides with the complement \u00f8verlineG of the graph G. In this paper we extend the previous notion and derive determinant based formulas for the number of spanning trees of graphs of the form K_n^m #x00b1 G, where K_n^m is the complete multigraph on n vertices with exactly m edges joining every pair of vertices and G is a multigraph spanned by a set of edges of K_n^m; the graph K_n^m + G (resp. K_n^m - G) is obtained from K_n^m by adding (resp. removing) the edges of G. Moreover, we derive determinant based formulas for graphs that result from K_n^m by adding and removing edges of multigraphs spanned by sets of edges of the graph K_n^m. We also prove closed formulas for the number of spanning tree of graphs of the form K_n^m #x00b1 G, where G is (i) a complete multipartite graph, and (ii) a multi-star graph. Our results generalize previous results and extend the family of graphs admitting formulas for the number of their spanning trees.",

Various prediction and approximation methods are applied in order to detect and extract those which provide the better differentiation between control and patient data, as well as members of different age groups. The prediction methods are local linear prediction, local exponential prediction, the delay times method, autoregressive prediction and neural networks. Approximation is computed with local linear approximation, least squares approximation, neural networks and the wavelet transform. These methods are chosen since each has a different physical basis and thus extracts and uses time series information in a different way.",

In this paper we extended the class of graphs which can be efficiently used in a software watermarking system by proposing an efficient codec system, ie, encoding and decoding algorithms that embed/extract watermark values into/from cographs through the use of self-inverting permutations. More precisely, we present a codec system which takes as input an integer \u03c9 as watermark value, converts it into a self-inverting permutation \u03c0*, and then encodes the permutation \u03c0* as a cograph. The main property of our codec system is its ability to encode the same integer \u03c9, using a self-inverting permutation \u03c0*, into more than one cograph. This property causes our system to be resilient to attacks since it can embed multiple copies of the same \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In a software watermarking environment, several graph theoretic watermark methods use numbers as watermark values, where some of these methods encode the watermark numbers as graph structures. In this paper we extended the class of error correcting graphs by proposing an efficient and easily implemented codec system for encoding watermark numbers as reducible permutation flow-graphs. More precisely, we first present an efficient algorithm which encodes a watermark number  as self-inverting permutation  and, then, an algorithm which encodes the self-inverting permutation  as a reducible permutation flow-graph  by exploiting domination relations on the elements of  and using an efficient DAG representation of . The whole encoding process takes O(n) time and space, where  is the binary size of the number  or, equivalently, the number of elements of the permutation . We also propose efficient decoding algorithms which extract the number  from the reducible permutation flow-graph  within the same time and space complexity. The two main components of our proposed codec system, i.e., the self-inverting permutation  and the reducible permutation graph , incorporate important structural properties which make our system resilient to attacks.",

            "Abstract": "The K_n-complement of a graph G, denoted by K_n-G, is defined as the graph obtained from the complete graph K_n by removing a set of edges that span G; if G has n vertices, then K_n-G coincides with the complement \u00f8verlineG of the graph G. In this paper we extend the previous notion and derive determinant based formulas for the number of spanning trees of graphs of the form K_n^m #x00b1 G, where K_n^m is the complete multigraph on n vertices with exactly m edges joining every pair of vertices and G is a multigraph spanned by a set of edges of K_n^m; the graph K_n^m + G (resp. K_n^m - G) is obtained from K_n^m by adding (resp. removing) the edges of G. Moreover, we derive determinant based formulas for graphs that result from K_n^m by adding and removing edges of multigraphs spanned by sets of edges of the graph K_n^m. We also prove closed formulas for the number of spanning tree of graphs of the form K_n^m #x00b1 G, where G is (i) a complete multipartite graph, and (ii) a multi-star graph. Our results generalize previous results and extend the family of graphs admitting formulas for the number of their spanning trees.",
