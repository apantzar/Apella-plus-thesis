Learning authentically implies that learners, simulating their present or future professional practice, gain medical experience in the process of diagnosing human diseases. This challenge is linked with a main educational task undertaken, ie, structuring an inter-active e-learning platform in the context of a novel teaching strategy. The relevant project entitled \u201cICT emodules on HistoPathology: a valuable online tool for students, researchers and professionals\u2013HIPON\u201d, and co-financed by the Lifelong Learning Program of the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, The Commission of the European Union, has been launched at the beginning of 2013. The project has resulted in an autonomous well-structured and user friendly, multi-language e-learning platform, specifically focused on histopathology, which provides a valuable teaching tool for students, researchers and professionals.The modern technologies\u2019 fast progress in recent years brings about the development of new teaching tools. The implementation of e-learning programs has progressively increased in medical education. Our up-to-date platform combines a virtual portfolio, a list of resources and links and, most importantly, characteristic case studies, presented on such a basis that way of thinking and experience is conveyed and acquired, instead of mere information. The basic concept underlying HIPON\u2019s methodology is to follow mixed learning pathways based on case studies, always taking",

The function of special education in Cyprus has been criticized as failing because it failed to include all children in teaching by providing them with equal opportunities to learning. In this paper, using the interpretive model of research we studied teachers\u2019 practices as a factor of marginalization of certain children, how they marginalize their pupils, and attempted to understand how marginalization, a result of teachers\u2019 practice, works. Through data analysis it indicated that some teachers marginalize children considered as having special needs.",

Our study takes an ethnographic perspective in examining how learners and instructors in two online courses use and interpret silence. The ways in which those learners and instructors eventually integrated silence into their online communication were interpreted as non\u2010participation, confusion, marginalization, and thoughtful reflection. These findings have implications that are relevant to instructors\u2019 efforts to create constructive online learning environments and view silence as an important aspect of social presence. We thus propose the need for the development of a deeper analysis\u2014both empirical and theoretical\u2014on the notions of online silence, social presence, and communication.",

The central project idea is to achieve this by incorporating science fiction (Sci-Fi) in science teaching. The aim of this paper is to present the framework and the lessons learned from designing and implementing the project.

Participants in the study were eight students and the teacher of a graduate teacher education course at a southwestern university. The theoretical framework of the study was based on symbolic interactionism and the methodological approach was based on the canons of interpretive research as Erickson (1986) laid them out. Data analysis identified several intentions driving interaction. These included discussing and exchanging ideas, negotiating aspects of the course, providing feedback, gaining access and status in a setting, and socializing. The discussion and data excerpts clearly illustrate that underneath the surface of what, appear as ordinary day-to-day interaction, there are multiple meanings that are constructed and assigned when \u2026",

The Council of Europe has recently stated that language teaching and learning are key elements towards European integration and mobility. This firm belief is at the root of the Common European Framework of Reference for languages (2001). One important aspect underlined by the Framework is the need for the European citizen to have a personal document describing all his/her linguistic experiences and certifications. This document is called the European Language Portfolio-ELP. At present many European Institutions have already accepted the suggestions given by the Framework and have created different paper versions of the Portfolio adapting the European ELP format to their specific needs. However the paper editions present some limits that may be overcome by a digital version of the ELP. We aim at creating a digital ELP for university students which would bring many advantages in terms of ODL.",

            "Abstract": "This paper describes an ongoing EU project concerned with developing an instructional design framework for virtual classes (VC) that is based on the theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI)(1983). The psychological theory of Multiple Intelligences (Gardner 1983) has received much credence within instructional design since its inception and has been implemented successfully in a wide array of traditional educational settings. Nonetheless, very little research has been carried out on developing frameworks for elevating MI into an e-learning environment. Specifically, the project hopes to adapt and utilize MI theoretical learning principles to create a virtual class specifically designed for instructing health and safety to construction managers. This paper explores the emerging principles from both theory and practice in order to identify the appropriate methodology for the successful incorporation of MI based instructional techniques in the virtual class design. Guidelines are provided on how the MI concept of \u2018entry points\u2019 can best be adapted for the specific learners (in this case construction managers) and class content (in this case health and safety). Of particular concern to this papers examination of \u2018entry points\u2019 is the potential for the deployment of intelligence profiling research to create a class tailor-made for construction managers while simultaneously adaptive to each learners individual needs. Emerging from this analysis, the paper will provide core recommendations including how to create problem based instructional activities that are directly related to both the participant\u2019s intelligence strengths and to the class content.",

            "Abstract": "The construction industry is a challenging mix of traditional hazards, on standard repetitive construction projects coupled with complex one off landmark projects. There is a compelling moral and business case for training and learning resources addressing health and safety training in the construction industry. A network of educational institutions within Europe have undertaken an initiative that addresses the delivery of health and safety training, using e-learning, on a pan European basis in the construction industry sector. An established training need module, based on an analysis of UK, Irish and Turkish health and safety statistics has been identified. The research work proposes to use the theory of multiple intelligences (MI) which postulates that there are several independent ability areas which individuals possess. The pilot material will be delivered using falls from heights as the subject matter. The development and refinement of the resources will take an action research methodology approach. The expected impact of this initiative is to develop a new innovative framework and educational resource using multiple intelligences that is directly focused on health and safety in the construction industry.",

In light of Mestrovic's (1997) notion of a \u2018post-emotional\u2019 society and the increasing role of ICT in education, it is argued that educators need to rethink, modify, or extend some of the assumptions made about the relationship between emotion and reason (e.g. as these assumptions are expressed in the traditional binaries between body and mind, and emotion and reason). The argument put forward is that opportunities and consequent decisions and actions about particular pedagogical practices and philosophies must engage with an analysis of the meaning and implications of these assumptions for learning and learners.",

One of the trends in the field of distance education is the development of virtual high schools. Virtual high schools are offering alternative solutions to educating K-12 students who are not well served otherwise. The Virtual High School is a consortium of high schools, which offers online courses taught by consortium teachers for students in participating schools. During the academic year 2000\u20132001, it offered more than 200 high school courses to nearly 4,000 students in 350 schools in 30 states in the US (Kozma et al., 2000).

This challenge is linked with an innovative project entitled \u201cICT emodules on HistoPathology: a valuable online tool for students, researchers and professionals-HIPON\u201d.Aim & Objectives: The project has resulted in a multi-language elearning platform which aims to imprint professional experience in a way that medical students, researchers and professionals can develop their own necessary practical dexterities in the huge field of modern Pathology.Methods: The basic concept underling HIPON\u2019s methodology is the introduction of experiential learning based on real cases. Experiential learning is a process through which students develop knowledge, skills, and values from direct experiences; the key element is the student, and knowledge is gained as a result of being personally involved in the pedagogical approach.Results: By implementing experiential learning, there is a move to a more student-centered view of learning. The educator\u2019s most important responsibility becomes to search out and construct meaningful educational experiences that allow students to solve real-world problems; the result is that any abstract, inert knowledge that students used to memorize from dusty textbooks comes alive as they participate in the practical application of knowledge.Conclusion: HIPON provides an innovative platform which introduces medical experience in diagnostic practical issues of Pathology.

The current metaphor of a \u2018global village\u2019 (regardless of physical access to ICT) is problematic, and can be interpreted as a form of electronic colonization. However, through such concepts as blurred identity, nomadism, and hybridity, a distinctly (post\u2010modern) ICT landscape can be redrawn in a way that accepts the global identity of the ICT, but denies the colonial erasure associated with the global\u2010village narrative. ICT, in themselves, cannot serve as an end in education, but the demand for critical education involving ICT is pressing as the effects of globalization are experienced. Three methods of promoting decolonizing criticality are proposed: critical emotional literacy, collective witnessing, and collective intelligence.",

We present the theoretical framework of the project, the dilemmas of peace education in light of the conflict in Cyprus, and then reflect on the lessons learned from the use of technology as a tool to address issues relating to environmental education and peace. We argue that such efforts are of particular importance because they aim at legitimizing a process of ongoing interaction. Thus, issues of interpersonal friendships, general beliefs in peace, and attitude change assume an interesting role in establishing communication channels that eventually aim at acknowledging each other\u2019s collective narratives. The obstacles on the road to peace in Cyprus are numerous; however, through the critical use of ICT each community\u2019s experiences of suffering may enhance its capacity to form wise and compassionate responses to the suffering of the other community.

            "Abstract": "The continuous striving for better teachers and better schools has taken many different paths. One such path involves the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in teaching and learning. It is clear that ICT is increasing access to information, inspiring new developments in teaching, and allowing individuals and communities to interact at any time. Debates between technology supporters and skeptics about the use of ICT in classroom teaching have been growing. Although disputes over the value of using ICT in education are one factor, the lack of availability of ICT in schools is another reason its use is limited. Other dynamics include the realities and culture of the typical classroom and teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills, beliefs, and expertise (CEO Forum on Educational Technology, 2000; Cuban, 2001; Moursund & Bielefeldt, 1999; Vrasidas & Glass, 2005), and particularly the lack of teacher professional development.Attempts to integrate ICT into the classroom are influenced by such things as the availability of the necessary technology infrastructure, support for teachers, accessible change models, teachers\u2019 practices, curriculum constraints, assessment practices, education policies, and professional development. Education reform efforts have emphasized the importance of integrating ICT in the classroom, citing these factors, and the need for quality teacher professional development to do so (Donnelly, Dove, Tiffany-Morales, Adelman, & Zucker, 2002; McIntyre & Byrd, 1998).

The theoretical underpinnings of the framework will be presented as well as the results from studies that led to the development and refinement of the framework will be discussed. This framework is based on symbolic interactionist ideas and extensive research in the areas of computer-mediated communication and distance education. The framework consists of the following categories: context, learner control, social presence, structure, feedback, dialogue, and interaction. The categories of the conceptual framework are characterized by a reciprocal determinism, and they are all parts of a broader system. The implications of this framework and the research that will be presented will be discussed in detail as they relate to the design and study of online learning environments.",

This question is dealt with in this chapter in the light of my experience as a language teacher educator, particularly within EuroPAL', a project aiming to promote pedagogy for autonomy in language education in Europe. Our team spent considerable time discussing and writing about learner and teacher autonomy and the connection between them. Actually, this has probably been the most challenging and controversial issue in our work, since it relates to the ideological underpinnings of pedagogy and teacher education, an area where disagreement is most likely to emerge. It is, however, a crucial issue if we do not want pedagogy for autonomy to be just one more methodological trend in the language teaching scenario.",

In several countries, the use of e-learning has now begun to noticeably contribute to economic growth. In Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean Sea located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, many large-scale e-learning initiatives are currently being undertaken by both public and private organizations, establishing the country as a center for education in the region.Between the 1960s and 1990s, educational technology efforts in Cyprus schools were limited to the use of traditional audiovisual equipment and a few educational radio and television programs produced by the government. In recent years, however, considerable efforts have been devoted to promoting lifelong learning and integrating information and commu-",

Previous studies we conducted showed similar results for 15-year-old students in various countries that took part in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). The purpose of this study was to look more closely at the computer use and achievement relationships to determine if similar patterns continue to exist in the TIMSS-R database. The results of this study did find similar types of relationships. More specifically, 15-year-old students in Cyprus who frequently used the Internet to communicate with other students, and who had teachers who frequently used computers in their classrooms tended to have lower scores than other students with fewer such opportunities. Similar results were found for science and mathematics. Finally, a non-surprising result of this study was that the students who own computers in their homes tend to have higher academic achievement than the students who do not have them.",

            "Abstract": "Increased use of technology and the Internet are beginning to blur the line between traditional face-to-face and distance education. Schools of all levels are recognizing the power of the Internet and are exploring ways to make education available to students of all ages. However, one of the criticisms that often come up in discussions of online learning is that it is passive and not as valuable as learning that takes place in face-to-face classrooms. Another criticism of online education is that instruction delivered via text-based computer conferencing lacks the visual and audible cues of communication that are present in face-to-face situations. Therefore, according to critics, online education cannot be as effective and efficient as education offered in face-to-face classroom settings.During this presentation we will illustrate different strategies that can be employed in creating engaging online classes. We will use concrete examples from online classes we developed for high school students as well as for undergraduate and graduate level college audiences. Particular emphasis will be placed on how to transform online learning from \u201ctext on the screen\u201d to a powerful engaging and interactive learning experience. Educators and instructional designers need to understand the capabilities and limitations of the web environment and the process that needs to be followed to successfully adapt existing curricula to the online environment.",

            "Abstract": "One surprising result of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is that computer use in the classroom was negatively associated with high student achievement in Cyprus, Hong Kong and the USA. The students from all three countries who indicated that they use computers in the classroom most frequently, were those with the lowest achievement on the TIMSS in 1995. For the purpose of this study, a similar comparison was made for 15-year-old USA students, based on the data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). The results of this study are clearer, however, since they show that it is not computer use itself that has a positive or negative effect on the science achievement of students, but the way in which computers are used. For example in this study, after controlling for the student\u2019s socioeconomic status in the USA, the results indicated that the students who used computers frequently at home including for the purpose of writing papers tended to have higher science achievement. However, the results of this study also show that science achievement was negatively related to the use of certain types of educational software. This indicates a result similar to that found in the TIMSS data, which might reflect the fact that teachers assign the use of the computer and of the educational software to the lower achieving students more frequently, so that these students can obtain more personal and direct feedback through educational software. It should be emphasized that this does not imply that computer use is the cause of the low science achievement for these students.",

More than eleven thousand teachers participated in professional development programs, which focused among others on computer literacy skills, pedagogical knowledge needed for technology integration, infusing technology-based activities in the curriculum, and online learning. In addition to a large-scale survey conducted, twenty-four case studies were developed in order to examine in depth the effectiveness of teacher professional development and the challenges faced by practicing teachers with respect to the integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the curricula. This paper discusses findings from the large scale survey and enriches the findings with qualitative data from the ethnographic case studies to illustrate insights on effective practices of ICT integration in Cyprus education. The findings presented in this paper shed light to the complexities of integrating ICT in teaching and learning. The research reported is the first of its kind to be conducted in the Cyprus context. Findings reveal that teachers are willing to integrate technology into their teaching practices. However, even though they realize the benefits of ICT integration, a lot of teachers today seem resistant to integrating technologies and using online learning environments.

We argue that such efforts are of particular importance because they aim at legitimizing a process of ongoing interaction. Thus, issues of interpersonal friendships, general beliefs in peace, and attitude change assume an interesting role in establishing communication channels that eventually aim at acknowledging each other\u2019s collective narratives.

Context is provided by the history of the situation, past interaction sequences, and the anticipation of future interaction sequences. There is a reflexive relationship between context and interaction that prevents us from isolating the two. To examine human activity, it is important to carefully study the context and the moment-to-moment events that lead to further interaction among people.

This paper discusses our work with a group of teachers at a Mid-western, suburban vocational school to implement a computer-based approach in teaching integrated curricular units. We examined the ways in which technology was used to help enhance instruction in the core areas of mathematics and science within career-centered classrooms. We found that teachers were reluctant to change their curricula and instead expected technology to adapt to their current teaching methods. These teaching methods reflected a static view of curriculum and the learning environment. Data were collected from interviews, email, and classroom observations of three teachers. We discuss the complex interactions among teacher attitudes, core content, technology, and career concerns that curriculum developers may face while engaging in technology-based reform efforts.",

            "Abstract": "Teacher preparation programs in the United States and around the world have finally begun to address this deficiency in their programs. The realization that technology is a powerful driving force in education coupled with a renewed emphasis on teacher preparation by governments have resulted in some dramatic changes in teacher preparation programs. I believe that we have just begun to see changes in teacher preparation and that the pace of change will continue to accelerate. This volume covers some of the more exciting developments in the field, including the emergence of wireless computing in the classroom and the preparation of teachers in an online environment. In short, I am optimistic. For those of you who are also in the field, I think you will agree. For those who are just entering the field, this book is a great place to start as you change education. Finally, while this book is the last book of the three part series that we at CAIT conceptualized with Charalambos Vrasidas and Gene Glass, it is also the beginning of a new relationship. We are excited to join with a new partner, CARDET, to present this book. Over many years in the education and R&D field, I have come to realize the value of partnerships and relationships. I want to thank both Charalambos and Gene for making this series a reality and such a success. We are looking forward to working with them and CARDET in the near future.",

Among the forces driving a renewed interest in teacher professional development are the use of technology for teaching and learning, a shift of pedagogical approaches toward constructivism, an emphasis on standardsdriven education, and systems thinking as it applies to career-long teacher education (Means, 1994; Sparks & Hirsh, 1997).",

            "Abstract": "In the 2006 construction and housing in Ireland report from the central statistics office revealed that 280,000 people worked in the construction sector. This represents 13% of total employment and is the highest in the European Union. The same report identifies the construction sector as containing the highest rate of fatalities accounting for one third of all work place related deaths. As a result, it is imperative to address health and safety issues in the construction sector. The research looks at providing innovative health and safety training through virtual classes that apply the principles of multiple intelligence (MI). It is proposed that two phases of virtual classes are developed, focusing on the risk of falls from height in the construction sector. These phases will be deployed using an action research approach to further refine and develop each phase. The use of a virtual classroom environment and the application of MI theory represent unique opportunities and challenges. Based on a literature review of current best practice in virtual classes, a survey has been developed to focus on understanding and measuring the user experience, and relating this to student usage of the system as a whole. It is anticipated that the framework developed for these virtual classes as well as the research findings will be hosted on a dedicated website. The website will act as a repository for developed content and virtual classes, as well as facilitating dissemination of the project outcomes. The outcome of the research is the development of an educational resource using MI theory that is directly focused on health and safety in the construction industry.",

The pathologist\u2019s interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establish the final diagnosis and therefore to estimate patients\u2019 prognosis and best treatment. In the immense field of modern pathology, an extensive amount of data is available; as many practical skills as possible are requested to be developed by future or present medical professionals.

            "Abstract": "In July 1999 the House of Parliament in Cyprus passed the Education Act for Children with Special Needs, according to which all children have the right to be educated in their neighbouring regular school together with their age\u2010mates. An important component of this law is that it introduces, for the first time, inclusive education into pre\u2010primary education. A child can be considered as having special needs only when he/she has attained the age of 3 years or older. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the policy of inclusive education is implemented in pre\u2010primary schools in Cyprus, to investigate whether some children are still marginalized (after the implementation of the new law) and, if they are, to identify factors influencing marginalization or acting as a barrier to inclusion. We also briefly present the results from a study we conducted that supports the discussion of the issues raised in this paper.",

            "Abstract": "The purpose of this research was to examine the affordances and opportunities from using online games in teacher professional development. Following an educational design research approach, we developed an environment to provide opportunities for in-service teachers to engage in-game-based activities. Our work presented in this manuscript was of exploratory nature. The basic questions that guided our inquiry were as follows: (1) What affordances do online game environments provide for teacher professional development? (2) What opportunities and challenges arise from the implementation of games for teacher learning? Data were collected from online design sessions, semi-structured interviews with all participants, online and face-to-face observations, focus group discussions, and artifact review. Findings showed that online games provide great opportunities for learner engagement and teacher \u2026",

People shop online, download news in their iPods, communicate via text and video, take digital photos, and conduct all manner of personal and professional business via the Internet. While these technologies have afforded new opportunities to improve efficiency, exponentially increase access to information, and expand the notion of global citizenship, they have also caused many researchers and educators to rethink what it means to be literate in this post-typographic world. It is not enough for citizens in the 21st century to know how to decode and comprehend information as they have in the past. They are also now responsible for efficiently and effectively finding and evaluating information as well as quickly adapting personal learning goals in response to the varied structures and complexities of these technology-enhanced \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the 2006 construction and housing in Ireland report from the central statistics office revealed that 280,000 people worked in the construction sector. This represents 13% of total employment and is the highest in the European Union. The same report identifies the construction sector as containing the highest rate of fatalities accounting for one third of all work place related deaths. As a result, it is imperative to address health and safety issues in the construction sector. The research looks at providing innovative health and safety training through virtual classes that apply the principles of multiple intelligence (MI). It is proposed that two phases of virtual classes are developed, focusing on the risk of falls from height in the construction sector. These phases will be deployed using an action research approach to further refine and develop each phase. The use of a virtual classroom environment and the application of MI theory represent unique opportunities and challenges. Based on a literature review of current best practice in virtual classes, a survey has been developed to focus on understanding and measuring the user experience, and relating this to student usage of the system as a whole. It is anticipated that the framework developed for these virtual classes as well as the research findings will be hosted on a dedicated website. The website will act as a repository for developed content and virtual classes, as well as facilitating dissemination of the project outcomes. The outcome of the research is the development of an educational resource using MI theory that is directly focused on health and safety in the construction industry.",

Emphasis is placed on policy and curriculum reform as they relate to the use of information technologies for teacher education. Particular reference is made to the situation in Cyprus public schools. It is argued that for successful technology integration, there needs to be a shift in pedagogical approaches and reform of teacher education programmes. Concluding, suggestions are provided on how information technologies can best be integrated in pre-service teacher education and in-service teacher professional development.

            "Abstract": "The capacity of online education to produce learning environments that are supportive of hybrid identities, complex discourses, and multiple relations among learners raises questions about the ethical response of online educators. To investigate the ethics of online education, we discuss two questions: How are identity and communication constituted in online education? What are the features of an ethical pedagogy in online education? Such questions help us think in alternative ways about the ethical dimensions of online education. We argue that Emmanuel Levinas's views on ethics and otherness can overcome some of the ethical challenges inherent in online education by helping educators and learners become more aware of how they respond to the Other and consider their ethical responsibility to the Other's multiple and complex identities. An ethical pedagogy for online education that takes seriously the \u2026",

Children and youth grow up digital; they use mobile devices, play games, and watch television for several hours a day. They spend hours in virtual worlds exploring and interacting with avatars and peers from around the world. Peter Kahn argues that the fact that the majority of our interaction is mediated with technology, impacts our experience and our well-being. He draws from a series of studies his team conducted over a period of seven years during which they investigated the ways in which children and adults experience different kinds of technological nature.His research team installed \u201ctechnological nature windows\u201d(50 \u2033plasma screens showing high-definition broadcasts of real-time local nature views) in offices on his university campus and assessed the physiological and \u2026",

The course has been designed at a time when SME managers are experiencing considerable performance pressures which impose time constraints on engagement in formal training processes. Some managers engage less in management development than their counterparts in larger organisations. E-learning, despite presenting the possibility of just-in-time training at any time and in any place, will not readily engage SME managers unless much care and attention is given to design.Based on a review of literature supported by focus groups, this paper presents the key issues identified by the project team in gaining the commitment of SME managers to the e-learning process, the background research which has informed the course design and the rationale being \u2026",

A few months later the same year, the second scholarly journal came into being, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in England (Gaines, 1996; Gu\u00e9don, 1996). Since the conception of paper scholarly journals, very little has changed about the way researchers and scientists report their work. As Glass (1999) argued,\" a reader in the year 2000 browsing a scientific journal from the year 1910 will find the environs thoroughly familiar.\"Paper journals have been used for scholarly communication and research reporting. Nevertheless, because of the delays in publishing and the exponential growth of knowledge and information, paper journals have become ineffective in promoting communication among the academic community. Interaction among scholars rarely takes place via paper journals.",
