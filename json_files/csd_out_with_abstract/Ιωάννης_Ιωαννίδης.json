The interface integrates a hierarchical vocabulary based on classical ballet syllabus terminology (Ballet. owl) implemented as an OWL-2 ontology. BalOnSe supports the search and browsing of the multimedia content using metadata (title, dancer featured, etc.), and also implements the functionality of\" searching by movement concepts\", ie, filtering the videos that are associated with particular required terms of the vocabulary, based on previous submitted annotations. In the paper, we present the ballet. owl ontology, and its structure, explaining the conceptual modeling decisions. We highlight the main functionality of the system and finally, we present how the \u2026",

We advocate Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA) as a suitable Semantic Web driven technology to address the challenge. We derive requirements for applying OBDA in Siemens, review existing OBDA systems and discuss their limitations with respect to the Siemens requirements. We then introduce the Optique platform as a suitable OBDA solution for Siemens. The platform is based on a number of novel techniques and components including a deployment module, BootOX for ontology and mapping bootstrapping, a query language STARQL that allows for a uniform querying of both streaming and static data, a highly optimised backend, ExaStream, for processing such data, and a query formulation interface, OptiqueVQS, that allows to formulate STARQL queries without prior knowledge of its formal syntax.

In particular, we describe a graph-theoretic framework with two primary parts:(a) a recommendation graph, modeling all the elements of an (application) domain from a recommendation perspective, including the subjects and objects of recommendations as well as the relationships between them;(b) a set of path operations, inferring new edges, ie, implicit or unknown relationships, by traversing and combining paths on the graph. The resulting path algebra model provides an abstraction and a common foundation that is beneficial to three aspects of recommendations:(a) expressive power-expression and subsequent use of several significantly different, existing but also novel recommendation approaches is reduced to parameterizing a unique model;(b) usability-by capturing part of the recommendation mechanisms \u2026",

Our translation mechanism is based on a graph-based approach to the query translation problem. We represent various forms of structured queries as directed graphs and we annotate the graph edges with template labels using an extensible template mechanism. Logos uses different graph traversal strategies for efficiently exploring these graphs and composing textual query descriptions. The audience may interactively explore Logos using various database schemata and issuing either sample or ad hoc queries.",

            "Abstract": "The description of the human body and its movement is fundamental and a critical part of the content of a Dance Digital Library. It must be captured in an organized way, both for allowing user interaction (browse, search) and computational analysis (similarity comparison) of dances, as well as for exploring meaningful ways to present content to users. In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling abstraction for such digital libraries, which consists of a multi-layered model that covers different levels for describing dance movement. We address the semantic challenge of organizing knowledge of dance by starting from defining a dance piece or work, going to the characterization of its structural movement components and their related concepts and standard detailed movement description and notation i.e., Labanotation. In addition, we take into account the existing chorological research, as well as, related work \u2026",

Existing systems are heterogeneous in scope and focus on very different aspects and functionality. These systems range from digital objects/metadata repositories, reference linking systems, archives and commercial systems that provide administration functions, to complex systems (mainly developed in research environments) that integrate advanced digital library services.Research on DLMSs concerns several different areas. It is often difficult to compare or combine the results achieved in these areas since it is not always clear how they are related, and how they can impact on or constrain one another. This fragmentation of results hinders the embedding of new research achievements into real world systems.",

In such a framework the focus is mainly on how better to handle the information collected. Task Information Management (TIM) on the other hand adopts a more usercentric view and aims to support users in performing their tasks. Possible ways of achieving this are to automatically find data users need in order to perform a task, to automate the execution of tasks and the synthesis of new more abstract tasks by identifying tasks users carry out often. PIM and TIM can be seen as complimentary since an efficient organization of personal information can help in the discovery of data relevant to a task. To this end, it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach in the design and implementation of a Task Information Management System.",

Relation R has an associated histogram H. The SQL query Q is translated to be a query Q\u2032 for operating on histogram H. Translated query Q\u2032 is executed on histogram H for obtaining a result histogram. The result histogram is expanded into a relation having tuples containing approximate attribute values.",

The users of the MagicHOLO mobile app are prompted to coordinate in order to create a common communication network for their devices and to decide on the elements to be included in the 3D presentation. By placing the devices in a specific order and distance and with the help of a 3D projecting pyramid, the synchronized video playback is converted into a three-dimensional digital imaging, designed to enhance the users' interaction with the exhibit in a playful and engaging way that promotes social interactions.",

This was the seventh meeting of this sort in twenty years, and was distinguished by a broad consensus that we are at a turning point in the history of the field, due both to an explosion of data and usage scenarios, and to major shifts in computing hardware and platforms. Given these forces, we are at a time of opportunity for research impact, with an unusually large potential for influential results across computing, the sciences and society. This report details that discussion, and highlights the group's consensus view of new focus areas, including new database engine architectures, declarative programming languages, the interplay of structured and unstructured data, cloud data services, and mobile and virtual worlds \u2026",

Inevitably, this will result in the development of on-line decision support systems, where users and analysts interactively explore large XML data sets through a declarative query interface (eg, XQuery or XSLT). Given the importance of remaining interactive, such on-line systems can employ approximate query answers as an effective mechanism for reducing response time and providing users with early feedback. This approach has been successfully used in relational systems and it becomes even more compelling in the XML world, where the evaluation of complex queries over massive tree-structured data is inherently more expensive. In this paper, we initiate a study of approximate query \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Digital Library universe is a complex framework bringing together many disciplines and fields, spanning data management, information retrieval, library sciences, document management, information systems, web image processing, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction and digital curation. The Digital Library universe is also an interplay of professional roles, encompassing cataloguing and curating, defining, customising and maintaining the Digital Library and its services, as well as developing and customising software. Such complexity and diversity in terms of approaches, solutions and systems has driven the need for common foundations that foster best practices and help focus further advancement in the field. The Digital Library Reference Model aims at contributing to the creation of such foundations. It is the result of a collective understanding on Digital Libraries that has been acquired by European research groups under the umbrella of the European funded DELOS Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries, as well as the international scientific community active in the field of Digital Libraries. The outcomes of DELOS have been taken forward by DL.org, a project funded by the Cultural Heritage and Technology Advanced Learning Unit of the Information Society Directorate-General of the European Commission, working in synergy with a team of international experts in the field to enhance and extend the Reference Model. The Digital Library Reference Model is a conceptual framework aimed at capturing significant entities and their relationships in the digital library universe with the goal of developing a concrete model of it \u2026",

            "Abstract": "ResultsThe final brainstorming session led to the common conclusion that\" very large\" issues in Digital Libraries should not be limited to those of\" size of content\", as for very large databases. Indeed, as motivated by the DELOS Reference Model for Digital Libraries [12], Digital Libraries are also affected by the dimensions of functionalities, policies, and users, which are equally important in this respect. For example, a Digital Library may be\" very large\" in terms of the communities and users it has to serve at the same time, or in terms of the heterogeneity of content that such communities bring in. Furthermore,\" largeness\" seems to be highly dependent on sustainability issues, often ruling the Digital Library world where funds are generally scarce and hard to guarantee for the long term. As a consequence, the adjective\" very large\" may label systems where the problem to be tackled might not look\" that large\" in other domains. For example, the adoption of GRID infrastructures or high performance computing solutions used by the physics community might not be a reasonable solution in the DL universe, unless proper business models are to be found. As a consequence, novel goals, such as sustainable and low cost hardware and software infrastructures (eg, D-Net software toolkit [13], gCube Software Toolkit [14]) and relative business models, become crucial research avenues in this area.",

            "Abstract": "As a large fraction of available information resides in databases, the need for facilitating access for the large majority of users becomes increasingly more important. Precis queries are free-form queries that generate entire multi-relation databases, which are logical subsets of existing ones. A logical subset contains not only items directly related to the given query selections but also items implicitly related to them in various ways with the purpose of providing to the user much greater insight into the original data. This paper is concerned with the definition and generation of logical database subsets based on precis queries under a generalized perspective that removes several restrictions of previous work and handles queries containing multiple terms combined using the operators AND, OR, and NOT.",

Inspired by e-commerce technology, we recognize CPU-processing and queries (and query answers) as commodities and model the task of query optimization and execution as a task of trading CPU-processing, queries and query-answers. We show that our framework satisfies the needs of modern DL federations by respecting the autonomy of DL nodes and natively supporting their business model. Our query processing conception is independent of the possible distributed architecture and can be easily implemented over a typical GRID architectural infrastructure or a Peer-To-Peer network.",

By integrating a text classification module, which leads to class probability estimation, along with a dimensionality reduction technique, which represents each class in the 2-D space, any collection of unlabelled documents can be visualized. The classification and visualization modules have been trained on three different datasets and respective categorizations. We provide an example of our system\u2019s functionality by visualizing the content of collections of publications which share a common funding scheme. In order to implement this, we have developed a funding mining submodule which identifies documents of particular funding schemes. All the individual modules have been implemented using the madIS system, which provides data analysis functionalities via an extended relational database.",

In its heart lies a rich user model able to capture several diverse aspects of users behavior and users interests, preferences, and attitudes. The user model is instantiated with profiles of individual or group users, which are obtained by analyzing and then appropriately interpreting potentially arbitrary pieces of user-relevant information coming from diverse sources. These profiles are maintained by the system, updated incrementally as additional data on users becomes available, and taken advantage of by a variety of applications to adapt the functionality of information systems to the users characteristics.",

In the current environment, however, where information prevails in most activities of society, serving people, applications, and devices in dramatically increasing numbers, this paradigm has proved to be very limited. On the query side, much work has been done on moving towards keyword queries over structured data. In our previous work, we have touched the other side as well, and have proposed a paradigm that generates entire databases in response to keyword queries. In this paper, we continue in the same direction and propose synthesizing textual answers in response to queries of any kind over structured data. In particular, we study the transformation of a dynamically-generated logical database subset into a narrative through a customizable, extensible \u2026",
