            "Abstract": "The recent interpretation of experiments on the nonlinear non-resonant birefringence induced in a weak probe beam by a high intensity pump beam in air and its constituents has stimulated interest in the non-resonant birefringence due to higher-order Kerr nonlinearities. Here a simple formalism is invoked to determine the non-resonant birefringence for higher-order Kerr coefficients. Some general relations between nonlinear coefficients with arbitrary frequency inputs are also derived for isotropic media. It is shown that the previous linear extrapolations for higher-order birefringence (based on literature values of n_2 and n_4) are not strictly valid, although the errors introduced in the values of the reported higher- order Kerr coefficients are a few percent.",

When contributions from the two-photon terms exceed those from the one-photon terms, the non-resonant intensity-dependent refractive index n_2>0, and vice versa.

Three antibiotics (sulfapyridine, sulfathiazole, and tetracycline) and two acaricides (coumaphos and amitraz) were characterized in the THz frequency regime between 0.5 THz and 6.0 THz. All chemical substances present distinct absorption peaks. THz transmission measurements of honey mixtures with antibiotics have been performed, revealing that antibiotic residues are traceable in highly absorptive food products, such as honey, at concentrations down to 1% weight percentage, thanks to their THz fingerprints. Moreover, multiple antibiotics were identified in their mixture with honey, pointing out the potential of the technique to be used in the near future as a fast, real-time technique for detecting and discriminating multi-residues strictly related to food safety issues.",

Our theory predicts that under this scheme sub-cycle THz pulses with multi-millijoule energies and record conversion efficiencies can be produced. Besides, we elucidate the origin of this high efficiency, which is made up of several factors, including a novel mechanism where the harmonics produced by the mid-infrared pulses strongly contribute to the field symmetry breaking and enhance the THz generation.

While the restrictions imposed by nonlinear propagation effects in semiconductors usually inhibit countless applications, the possibility to perform semiconductor\u2013metal ultrafast laser welding is demonstrated.

The plasma was simultaneously diagnosed with X-ray (in the wavelength range of 6\u20138 \u00c5 for Kr and of 12\u201315 \u00c5 for Xe) and time-resolved XUV (20\u2013200 \u00c5) emission spectroscopy. Electron density and temperature as well as the ionization charge were measured by time-resolved Thomson scattering of the heating laser pulse. The spectra are compared with the calculations performed with the NLTE collisional-radiative code AVERROES/TRANSPEC. Best fits of the X-ray and XUV spectra obtained are presented. The measured charge distribution and dynamics is analyzed using the simultaneous Thomson scattering diagnostic.",

Two femtosecond beams of the 100 TW laser at the LULI facility were used to produce an aluminum plasma on a thin aluminum foil (83 or 50 nm), and a picosecond x-ray backlighter source. The short-pulse backlighter probed the aluminum plasma at different times by adjusting the delay between the two femtosecond driving beams. Absorption x-ray spectra at early times are characteristic of a dense and rather homogeneous plasma. Collisional-radiative atomic physics coupled with hydrodynamic simulations reproduce fairly well the measured average ionization as a function of time.",

Numerical simulations, with unidirectional propagation models for the pulse envelope and the carrier resolved electric field, reveal that the driving mechanism for this unexpected intensity increase is due to the self-generated plasma. The plasma formation, in conjunction with the circular geometry of the beam, force the wave packet into a multistage collapse process which takes place faster than the saturating mechanisms can compensate. We report here a nonstandard mechanism that increases the intensity of a collapsing wave packet, due to the joint contributions of the cubic phase of the Airy beam and the formation of a partially reflecting plasma.",

The structure shows enhanced absorption originating from constructive interference of the impinging and reflected waves at the absorbing graphene sheet. The modulation of this absorption, which is demonstrated via a THz time-domain spectroscopy setup, is achieved by applying an optical pump signal, which modifies the conductivity of the graphene sheet. We report an ultrafast (on the order of few ps) absorption modulation on the order of 40% upon photoexcitation.

Contrary to what was believed, strong scattering in the optical paths can be exploited in favor of light focusing through turbid media and ultimately improve optical imaging and light manipulation capabilities. The use of light shapers and appropriately engineered scattering structures, i.e. opaque lenses enables the production of nano-scale confined foci and of extended fields of view. Exploiting this concept we fabricate configurable scattering structures by direct femtosecond laser writing. The properly shaped light trespassing the customized structure, a photonic lattice of parallel rods, forms a light-sheet at user defined positions. We demonstrate that our technique enables light-sheets with sub-micron resolution and extended depth of focus, a significant advantage when compared to the existing free space systems. Moreover, our approach permits to focus light of different wavelengths onto the same defined position without moving any optical element and correcting for chromatic aberrations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an opaque cylindrical lens can be created using a biological structure, hence unveiling the potential advantages for optical microscopic and mesoscopic imaging.",

In the case of fused silica we reveal the physical conditions for the formation of nanogratings, measuring excited electron densities well below the critical density while for PMMA we show that excited electrons with densities exceeding 1018 cm\u22123, exhibit complex trapping dynamics in a 200 fs time scale.

Multilayer thin film stacks, 2D photonic crystals, etc. as coating structures improved the thermal emission rate of a device in the infrared atmospheric transparency window reducing considerably devices' temperature. Due to the increased heating in photovoltaic (PV) devices, that has significant adverse consequences on both their efficiency and life-time, and inspired by the recent advances in daytime radiative cooling, we developed a coupled thermal-electrical modeling to examine the physical mechanisms on how a radiative cooler affects the overall efficiency of commercial photovoltaic modules. Employing this modeling, which takes into account all the major processes affected by the temperature variation in a PV device, we evaluated the relative impact of the main radiative cooling approaches proposed so far on the PV efficiency, and we established required conditions for optimized radiative cooling. Moreover, we identified the validity regimes of the currently existing PV-cooling models which treat the PV coolers as simple thermal emitters. Finally, we assessed some realistic photonic coolers from the literature, compatible with photovoltaics, to implement the radiative cooling requirements, and demonstrated their associated impact on the temperature reduction and PV efficiency. Providing the physical mechanisms and requirements for cooling radiatively solar cells, our study provides guidelines for utilizing suitable photonic structures as radiative coolers, enhancing the efficiency and \u2026",

The analogy between solid-states physics and the light propagation in specifically engineered arrayed structures generally leads to gapped dispersion relations. More recently, photonics borrowed concepts from topological insulators (TIs) which possess topologically nontrivial gapped bandstructure [1]. For finite systems, the number of topologically protected states, localized at the interface, can be predicted by simply comparing the topological invariants associated to the bandstructures of each system. It was also proposed that topological states may arise, when a system is subjected to a non-adiabatic time-periodic potential.

The high laser intensities attained generate plasma through multi-photon absorption and electron avalanche processes in the bulk of the material. Depending on the initial experimental conditions three distinct types of structural changes in the material are observed, from small changes of the refractive index to birefringence, and even cracks and voids. We also observe the creation of micro-channels, up to 115 \u03bcm in length, inside the material due to self-guiding and filamentation of the laser pulses in the transparent material. The selective change of the refractive index is a promising method for the fabrication of photonic structures such as waveguides and three-dimensional integrated optical devices. ",

To study in more detail the characteristics and the origin of these high AOD values, a campaign took place in Greece in the frame of the PHOENICS (Particles of Human Origin Extinguishing Natural solar radiation In Climate Systems) and EARLINET (European Aerosol Lidar Network) projects during August\u2013September of 2003, which included simultaneous sunphotometric and lidar measurements at three sites covering the north-south axis of Greece: Thessaloniki, Athens and Finokalia, Crete. Several events with high AOD values have been observed over the measuring sites during the campaign period, many of them corresponding to Saharan dust. In this paper we focused on the event of 30 and 31 August 2003, when a dust layer in the height range of 2000-5000 m, progressively affected all three stations. This layer showed a complex behavior concerning its spatial evolution and allowed us to study the changes in the optical properties of the desert dust particles along their transport due to aging and mixing with other types of aerosol. The extinction-to-backscatter ratio determined on the 30 August 2003 at Thessaloniki was approximately 50 sr, characteristic for rather spherical mineral particles, and the measured color index of 0.4 was within the typical range of values for desert dust. Mixing of the desert dust with other sources of aerosols resulted the next day in overall smaller and less absorbing population of particles with a lidar ratio of 20 sr. Mixing of \u2026",

The broad spectral bandwidths, high peak powers, and (3+1)-dimensional nature of these fields give rise to complex linear and nonlinear effects that have posed significant challenges to researchers. In the last years an important effort has been devoted to the study of the propagation of powerful laser beams in atmosphere as well as in other transparent media, i.e. glasses. A particular interest has focused on femtosecond laser systems, able to deliver very high peak powers with a modest energy output. Due to the high power the nonlinear response of the medium plays a key role in the propagation. A very unusual and spectacular propagation of light has been observed recently. Intense ultrashort laser pulses launched in air self-organize into filaments, which persist over very long distances.",

There are two physical mechanisms responsible for the THz generation in this scheme: four-wave mixing and emission from the induced plasma currents. The case when the main and second harmonic are linearly polarized is well studied including the impact from each of the above mechanisms. However, for the cases when the two-color fields have complex polarization states the role of the four-wave mixing and plasma mechanisms in the formation of the THz polarization is still under-explored. Here we use both the four-wave mixing and photocurrent models in order to consider the THz generation by two-color fields with arbitrary polarizations. We show that under specific polarizations of the two-color field components it is possible to determine which of the mechanisms is responsible for the THz polarization formation.",

Freak waves are typically defined as waves with a height (trough to crest) that exceed the average wave altitude by a factor of two or more [1]. Although their extreme nature, the first freak wave ever recorder, occurred in 1995 allowing the confirmation of their existence [2]. Similar, extreme, phenomena were soon estimated that could take place in other areas, such as photonics. In this region a freak wave would be an Electromagnetic wave (signal) that would be significantly fiercer than the rest of the signals measured, contiguous to the oceanic phenomenon. Today in the community two main different approaches exist to explain such phenomena, supporting either the linear or the nonlinear wave dynamics interpretations.",

Fast-frame camera pictures allow the evaluation of the influence of the negative leader propagation on the triggering and guiding process. We show that the plasma channel can either trigger a space-leader discharge or act as a guiding path for the negative leader head. For the latter case the results suggest a linear dependence of the guided lengths up to 2.4 m, while the formation of a space-leader reduces this guided length by up to 50%. This effect is explained by the limited plasma lifetime of the filament that is measured to be about 1 \u03bcs. ",

Various excitation wavelengths and gases have been explored in the search for a stronger THz wave emission from laser-induced plasmas, whereas few attempts have been made with artificially modulated exotic wavepackets. Here we demonstrate that abruptly autofocusing-beam-induced air-plasma can give a 5.3-times enhanced THz wave pulse energy compared to normal Gaussian-beam-induced plasma under the same conditions.

This focusing geometry reduces detrimental nonlinear beam distortions and enhances energy deposition within the medium, localized at the focal spot. We observe remarkable postcollapse dynamics of elongated cavitation bubbles with high-speed ejection of microbubbles out of the laser focal region. Bubbles are ejected along the laser axis in both directions (away and towards the laser). The initial shape of the cavitation bubble is also seen to either enhance or completely suppress jet formation during collapse. In the absence of jetting, microbubble ejection occurs orthogonal to the laser propagation axis.",

During a first self-focusing stage that is affected by modulational instability, the beam is shown to break up into two channels of light that finally coalesce into a narrow filament that is able to propagate over several Rayleigh lengths. The filament propagation is associated with the generation of an electron plasma, whose density is greater than 10^16 cm^\u22123. Electron generation persists well beyond the focal region. The simulations restore the global dynamics of the pulse, including the main stages of Kerr focusing, light guiding driven by ionization, and the ultimate diffraction of the beam.",

Such sources present major advantages for applications of sensing, spectroscopy, imaging, and nonlinear optics. In view of the numerous applications an understanding of the spatial distribution of the terahertz radiation, from this source, is crucial. One of the first works towards this direction [1], revealed a highly directional THz radiation while a more recent publication [2] proposes a donut-shape spatial pattern.

The continuously increasing interest for terahertz waves and their applications is fostered by their non-invasive nature (1 THz= 4.43 meV photon energy) and their ability to penetrate through many materials [5], which are usually opaque in the infrared and visible. Additionally, several physical and chemical processes, not accessible before, are closely related to the low frequency dynamic modes such as crystalline lattice or inter-molecular vibrational modes, hydrogen bonding stretches, large-scale motions of an entire macromolecule, which are lying in this low-frequency range. Up to date, numerous techniques have been tested and developed as THz sources and many of them, such as photoconductive antennas and optical rectification, are widely employed in various laboratories around the world. Using techniques like electro-optic (eo)[6] or photoconductive sampling [7], it is possible to coherently detect in the time domain the generated THz pulses, giving a direct access to the amplitude and more importantly the phase of the electric field. Yet, there is still a stumbling block for many applications in the THz regime due to the relatively low THz peak power that most of the existing techniques exhibit, with energies per pulse barely reaching the nano-Joule regime, while their further development is hindered by the lack of natural occurring materials exhibiting \u2026",

Nonlinear propagation of ultrashort THz pulses is another intriguing topic [3].

Spectral characterization of broadband THz radiation is not an easy task. One of the most common methods of THz detection is electro-optic sampling [5] with a lack in the detection bandwidth though, which is considerably narrower than the entire spectrum of THz pulses emitted during two-color filamentation.",

The peak intensity in the light channels is at least one order of magnitude lower than required for multiphoton ionization of air molecules. A detailed comparison is made between experiments and realistic 3+1-dimensional numerical simulations. It reveals that the mechanism limiting the growth of intensity by filamentation is connected with broken revolution symmetry in the transverse diffraction plane. ",

Combining a special design of 3D meta-devices and the ultrafast dynamics of low temperature grown gallium arsenide, we can modulate the reflectance of the THz microcavities within 2.2 ps. The device enables a 280 GHz switch in resonance frequency within less than 200 fs. The switch back to the original resonance takes 800 fs. Experimental results show that the speed values are strongly convoluted by the THz probing field and, thus, the real switching times are even shorter, in the few 100 fs range.",

We demonstrate the existence of stationary nonlinear Airy beams in a planar geometry. These beams preserve the intensity profile and the transverse acceleration of the Airy peak. We show that stationary propagation is sustained by a continuous energy flux to the main Airy lobe from its neighbors. For powers in the main Airy lobe exceeding a certain threshold, this stationary propagation regime becomes unstable. We extend our results to the 2-dimensional case: Airy beams with high powers in the main lobe reshape into a multifilamentary pattern induced by Kerr and multiphoton nonlinearities. The nucleation of new filaments and their interaction, affects the acceleration of the main Airy lobes. Experiments performed in water corroborate the existence of these two regimes.",

We consider wavelengths in the range from 0.6 to 10.6 m, thus covering the whole range of existing and future powerful laser sources in the near, mid and far-infrared. We show how different parameters of two-color filaments and generated THz pulses depend on the laser wavelength. We demonstrate that there is an optimal laser wavelength for two-color filamentation that provides the highest THz conversion efficiency and results in generation of extremely intense single cycle THz fields.",

They show that a quasidynamic equilibrium between multiphoton ionization and self-focusing drives the filamentation process, while temporal dispersion plays a negligible role.",

Here, in the framework of femtosecond-laser-written waveguide arrays, we present the first experimental realization of such a channel with judiciously engineered couplings. Various sources of imperfections and defects are identified, which are associated with the engineering procedure and affect the communication.",

Here we present that ultrafast modulation response in a graphene thin film absorber which can be assessed with use of a broadband THz time-domain-spectroscopic system (THz-TDS) in an IR pump-THz probe configuration. The simple scheme of the absorber can be used as a platform for ultrafast flat optics and metasurfaces.",

The conversion efficiencies of the first and second Stokes in H2, D2 and H2/D2 mixtures have been measured precisely in the 1\u201314 atm range. The SRS beam profiles were recorded for different gas pressures in the high-pressure Raman cell and interesting behaviour is revealed. Homogeneous SRS spatial profiles were obtained only for pressures higher than 7 atm. For lower pressures the profiles are either in the form of a ring or of a more complicated shape. The results are explained in terms of nonlinear self-focusing processes during the pump beam propagation in the Raman cell. Also, from our measurements, a more precise value of the nonlinear index of refraction for the H2 and D2 at 266 nm is proposed. ",

We have demonstrated that manipulating the speckle pattern spatial components can structure the shape of the focus. Exploiting selectively spatial-frequencies from the speckle components we realized opaque lenses able to produce sub-correlation foci and Bessel beams.",

Whereas three-dimensional (3D) femtosecond laser micromachining in dielectrics is highly advanced, it remains extremely challenging in narrow bandgap materials such as silicon (Si). Recent numerical and experimental investigations show that only an underdense microplasma can be generated inside the bulk of crystalline Si by two-photon absorption [2]. The energy deposition inside the material is drastically limited by significant losses in the prefocal region and strong plasma effects. We provide in this study an experimental evidence of this optical limitation by 3D-imaging of the beam propagation with 60-fs, 1300-nm pulses focused 1 mm under the Si-surface. Even for high Numerical Aperture (NA)(up to 0.65), we observe a strict clamping of the delivered energy far below \u2026",

This is shown to take place with a characteristic time constant of 350 fs, significantly shorter than previously reported in gold. This difference is ascribed to a weaker screening of the electron-electron interaction by the d-band electrons in silver than in gold. These results are in quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of the electron relaxation dynamics using a reduced static screening of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction, and including bound electron screening.

We show, that, in contrast to other models, emission is always conical, resulting from phase matching of the radiation produced inside the filament combined with a partial back reflection of the generated terahertz field from the filament itself due to the frequency-dependent critical plasma density. The obtained conical angle varies from 2\u2218 to 10\u2218, depending on the plasma density distribution and filament length. Unlike previously proposed models, our model shows good agreement with our experiments as well as a wide range of experimental findings from the literature.",

During propagation, low-and high-order non-linear effects, including the Kerr effect, multiphoton absorption and ionization, lead to an uncontrolled complex reshaping of the optical wavepacket that involves pulse splitting, refocusing cycles in space and significant variations of the focus. Here we demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that intense, abruptly autofocusing beams in the form of accelerating ring-Airy beams are able to reshape into non-linear intense light-bullet wavepackets propagating over extended distances, while their positioning in space is extremely well defined. These unique wavepackets can offer significant advantages in numerous fields such as the generation of high harmonics and attosecond physics or the precise micro-engineering of materials.",

Our analysis shows that the acceleration of the Airy peak, an inherent feature of linear Airy beam propagation, is preserved only for powers in the main Airy lobe below a certain threshold. Nonlinear propagation of intense Airy beams with low power in the main lobe is sustained by a continuous energy flux from its neighbors, similarly to the mechanism sustaining nonlinear Bessel beam propagation. Airy beams with higher powers in the main lobe are reshaped into a multifilamentary pattern induced by Kerr and multiphoton nonlinearities. The nucleation of new \u2026",

These can vary from small changes of the refractive index to birefringence, cracks and voids. This restructuring of the medium is due to the high laser intensities attained, and the plasma that is generated through multi-photon processes. The restructuring comes in the form of a string, which is the result of the nonlinear propagation of the laser beam in the medium as a self-trapped filament. We resume the conditions for the generation of the different types of modifications and comment on the temporal evolution and the role of the plasma strings at the trail of the light filaments.",
