            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of designing a virtual topology to minimize electronic routing, that is, grooming traffic, in wavelength routed optical rings. We present a new framework consisting of a sequence of bounds, both upper and lower, in which each successive bound is at least as strong as the previous one. The successive bounds take larger amounts of computation to evaluate, and the number of bounds to be evaluated for a given problem instance is only limited by the computational power available. The bounds are based on decomposing the ring into sets of nodes arranged in a path, and adopting the locally optimal topology within each set. Our approach can be applied to many virtual topology problems on rings. The upper bounds we obtain also provide a useful series of heuristic solutions.",

A few advanced networks, mainly National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), such as Surfnet, National Lambda Rail and Internet 2, now provide mechanisms for end-users to reserve and provision lightpaths via middleware referred to as Network Resource Mangers (NRMs). Although, some progress has been made in automated intra-domain lightpath services, inter-domain lightpath provisioning still requires manual intervention and presents several key challenges such as scalability of topology information exchanged, consistency and scalability of information model, security of access to the resources, hybrid networking and multi-layer lightpaths, and accounting and billing.

The fast reroute (FRR) mechanism has been standardized to achieve fast local repair of label switched paths (LSPs) in the event of link or node failures. We present a suite of hybrid protection schemes for MPLS networks that combine the well-known p-cycle method with FRR technology. Whereas with pure FRR backup paths are planned by each node individually, the hybrid schemes employ a set of p-cycles that may be selected using techniques that take a holistic view of the network so as to share protection bandwidth effectively. The hybrid FRR/p-cycle methods are fully RFC 4090-compliant, yet allow network operators to leverage a large existing body of p-cycle design techniques. Numerical results on realistic network topologies indicate that the hybrid approach is successful in combining the advantages of p-cycle design \u2026",

Despite these attractive features, adoption of advance reservations is limited mainly due to the fact that related algorithms are typically complex and fail to scale to large and loaded systems. In this work we consider two aspects of advance reservations. First, we investigate the impact of heterogeneity on Grid resource management when advance reservations are supported. Second, we employ techniques from computational geometry to develop an efficient heterogeneity-aware scheduling algorithm. Our main finding is that Grids may benefit from high levels of resource heterogeneity, independently of the total system \u2026",

However, wide deployment of such networks depends on addressing effectively two critical challenges: inter-core crosstalk, which may cause serious signal performance degradation in an MCF link, and survivability against network failures that may cause enormous data loss. In this article, we consider the design of MCF-EONs with shared-backup path protection (SBPP), one of the most efficient techniques for protecting network traffic. Specifically, we tackle the crosstalk-aware routing, core, and spectrum assignment (CA-RCSA) problem with the objective of jointly minimizing the network spectrum resources used and the total inter-core crosstalk. We formulate the problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) model subject to strict inter-core crosstalk limits for \u2026",

An ERON is an overlay-control network created by installing readily available MEMS optical switches, and implementing a GMPLS control plane at sites interconnected by static lightpaths. The switches and control software are deployed at the edge of the network and operated by the organization-user (i.e., outside the network provider's control), hence the term \u201cedge-reconfigurable\u201d.

A quantized network offers a small set of service levels (tiers), and each flow is mapped to one of the service levels so as to guarantee a QoS at least as good as that requested by the flow. Traffic quantization trades off a small amount of system resources for simplicity in core network functions, including packet scheduling, traffic policing, etc. Our focus in this paper is on determining the service levels so as to minimize the amount of additional resources required by a quantized network. We develop a framework for addressing the traffic quantization problem by formulating it as a variant of the \u0432-median problem under a new distance measure, the directional rectilinear distance. We present an efficient optimal algorithm for the directional \u0432-median problem on the real line, and a robust heuristic for the same problem in multiple dimensions; these two problems correspond to quantization of a single and multiple traffic parameters, respectively. Our main finding is that, by appropriately selecting the set of service levels, the benefits of quantization can be achieved with only a small sacrifice in network resources.",

The results demonstrate that, in general, adaptive path selection outperforms shortest path routing, and, depending on the path strategy involved, the network topology, and the traffic pattern, this improvement can be significant.

Three different scheduling strategies are presented, namely: separate scheduling of unicast and multicast traffic, treating multicast traffic as a number of unicast messages, and treating unicast traffic as multicasts of size one. A lower bound on the schedule length for each strategy is first obtained. Subsequently, the strategies are compared against each other using extensive simulation experiments in order to establish the regions of operation, in terms of a number of relevant system parameters, for which each strategy performs best.

As the number of logical entities (including sub-wavelength channels, wavelengths, wavebands, and \ufb01bers) that need to be controlled in a multigranular network increases rapidly with the network size, wavelength capacity, and load, a scalable framework for managing these entities becomes a sine qua non for future wide area WDM networks. Several variants of the tra\ufb03c grooming problem have been studied in the literature under a range of assumptions regarding the network topology, the nature of tra\ufb03c, and the optical and electronic switching model [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Typically, an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation serves as the basis for reasoning about and tackling the problem. Unfortunately, solving the ILP directly does not scale to instances with more than a handful of nodes, and cannot be applied to networks of practical size covering a national or international geographical area. Consequently, either the ILP is tackled using standard relaxation techniques, or the problem is decomposed into subproblems which are solved using heuristics. Most of the above studies regard the network as a \ufb02at entity for the purposes of lightpath routing, wavelength assignment, and tra\ufb03c grooming. It is well known, however, that in existing networks resources are typically managed and controlled in a hierarchical manner.

            "Abstract": "We consider the general problem of optimizing the performance of OBS networks with multiple traffic classes subject to strict (absolute) QoS constraints in terms of the end-to-end burst loss rate of each guaranteed class of traffic. We employ Markov decision process (MDP) theory to obtain optimal wavelength sharing policies for two performance objectives, namely, maximization of weighted network throughput and minimization of the loss rate of best-effort traffic, while meeting the QoS guarantees. The randomized threshold policies we obtain are simple to implement and operate, and make effective use of statistical multiplexing. In particular, the threshold randomization feature enables the policies to allocate bandwidth at arbitrarily fine sub-wavelength granularity, hence making effective use of the available network capacity.",

            "Abstract": "Multi-threading is a widely used program execution model, where each thread executes independently, while sharing some of the process resources. Multi-threaded processes are used for a range of network application servers including web-servers, mail-servers and SIP Proxy servers (SPS) for Voice over IP (VoIP). In this work, we investigate the performance of OpenSIPS, an open source SIP proxy server. We have collected a large set of experimental data, in a methodical fashion to characterize the performance of SPS as a function of number of server threads and call arrival rates. We model the SIP proxy server as an M/G/c/K queue. Our model includes two parameters that capture two aspects of the computing environment that affect the SPS performance: the overhead due to interrupts that we introduced in earlier study of a single-thread server, and the contention among multiple threads. Using these parameters, the queuing model accurately predicts the call arrival rate at which the drop probability exceeds 1%, for a given number of server threads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parametrized queuing model for a SIP proxy server. Our measurement and modeling methodology may be extended to allow network operators to predict the performance capabilities of a range of network application servers.",

Advance reservation mechanisms provide the ability to allocate resources to users based on agreed-upon QoS requirements and increase the predictability of a Grid system, yet incorporating such mechanisms into current Grid environments has proven to be a challenging task due to the resulting resource fragmentation. We use concepts from computational geometry to present a framework for tackling the resource fragmentation, and for formulating a suite of scheduling strategies. We also develop efficient implementations of the scheduling algorithms that scale to large Grids.

The clustering phase is very important for the final grooming result. Various clustering approaches have been considered in literature; however, not all are suitable for traffic grooming application because they do not take grooming goals into account. In this work, we select a suitable existing clustering algorithm, developed for the K-center problem, and study its performance as a clustering algorithm for hierarchical grooming.

            "Abstract": "Network function virtualization (NFV), with its perceived potential to accelerate service deployment and to introduce flexibility in service provisioning, has drawn a growing interest from industry and academia alike over the past few years. One of the key challenges in realizing NFV is the service chain routing problem, whereby traffic must be routed so as to traverse the various components of a network service that have been mapped onto the underlying network. In this work, we consider the online service chain routing problem with the goal of minimizing the maximum network congestion. To this end, we present a simple yet effective online algorithm in which the routing decision is irrevocably made without prior knowledge of future requests. We prove that our algorithm is O(log m)-competitive, where m is the number of edges of the underlying network topology, and we show that this ratio is asymptotically optimal.",

We review a typical integer linear program formulation considered in the literature, and we identify two challenges related to this formulation in terms of scalability and wavelength fragmentation. We then propose a new (to our knowledge) solution approach that decomposes the traffic grooming problem into two subproblems that are solved sequentially: 1) the virtual topology and traffic routing (VTTR) subproblem, which does not take into account physical topology constraints, and 2) the routing and wavelength assignment subproblem, which reconciles the virtual topology determined by VTTR with the physical topology. The decomposition is exact when the network is not wavelength limited. We also propose an algorithm that uses a partial linear programming relaxation technique driven by lightpath utilization \u2026",

A Cuckoo Search inspired technique is used, and task assignment to resources is done by validating the solution with the least value of cost.",

In practice however, economic and technical considerations are likely to dictate a more limited and sparse deployment of wavelength converters in the optical network. Therefore, we expect wavelength assignment policies to be an important component of OBS networks. In this paper, we explain why wavelength selection schemes developed for wavelength routed networks are not appropriate for OBS. We then develop a suite of adaptive and non-adaptive policies for OBS switches. We also apply traffic engineering techniques to reduce wavelength contention through traffic isolation. Our performance study indicates that, in the absence of full conversion capabilities, intelligent choices in assigning wavelengths to bursts at the source can have a profound \u2026",

Our analysis accounts for several important parameters, including the burst offset length, and the optical switching and hardware processing overheads associated with bursts as they travel across the network. The contributions of our work include:(i) analytical models of JET and Horizon (on a single OBS node) that are more accurate than previously published ones, and which are valid for general burst length and offset length distributions; and (ii) the determination of the regions of parameter values in which a more complex reservation scheme reduces to a simpler one. We compare the performance of the three wavelength reservation schemes on a single OBS node under various sets of parameter values. Our major finding is that, under reasonable assumptions regarding the current and future state-of-the-art in optical switch and electronic hardware technologies, the simplicity of JIT seems to outweigh any performance benefits of Horizon and JET.",

In a previous paper [18], we modeled the edge OBS node as a closed multi-class non-product-form queueing network, which we analyzed approximately by decomposition. In this paper, we develop computationally efficient approximate algorithms to analyze an edge node in the limiting case where the number of wavelengths is large.

Computing in the workplace is pervasive and involves many complex tools, many approaches to problem solving, strategic decision making, and synthesis. Knowledge, comprehension, and application are no longer enough for one to be labeled highly competent in computing. A successful engineer will need a mastery of computing applicable to the higher level cognitive skills of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, as well. To prepare students for pervasive, advanced computing in the workplace, we must begin to think in terms of pervasive, advanced computing in their education. This premise served as the basis for a project funded by the National Science Foundation CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH) initiative in 2007. The project is being carried out by the authors comprised of a multidisciplinary team of faculty from six departments in the College of Engineering and one from the College of Education at North Carolina State University.The project has two overarching goals:(1) create a computational thinking thread in the engineering curriculum that spans from the freshman to senior years and bridges the divide between freshman year computing and computing in upper-level classes, and (2) enable students to take computing competency to the next level, where they are able to perform high-level computing tasks within the context of a discipline.

We first show that this problem can be modeled as the shortest path tour problem (SPTP) that has been studied in different contexts. We then review and implement a suite of algorithms that use a variety of solution approaches for tackling SPTP, and we also develop a new algorithm.

In this work we present an efficient online algorithm for co-allocating resources that also provides support for advance reservations. The algorithm utilizes data structures specifically designed to organize the temporal availability of resources, and implements co-allocation through efficient range searches that identify all available resources simultaneously.

In OBS, data and control packet known as burst header packet (BHP) are sent out of band (i.e., control packets and data bursts are carried by different channels) and it is sent ahead of the data burst to reserve necessary network resources for the corresponding burst. After the elapse of a predetermined time known as offset time, the data burst is sent with the hope that, the control packet was able to make necessary reservations. Sending the BHP ahead of the burst exposes the burst to different security challenges, particularly data burst redirection and denial of service \u2026",

We present a suite of path switching strategies, each utilizing a different type of information regarding the link congestion status, and evaluate them using simulation. Our results demonstrate that, in general, path switching outperforms shortest path routing, and, depending on the path strategy involved, the network topology, and the traffic pattern, this improvement can be significant. We also present a new framework for the development of hybrid path switching strategies, which make routing decisions based on a weighted \u2026",

In our experiments, the new formulation decreases the running time by more than two orders of magnitude without any impact on optimality. The link selection techniques are general in that they may be applied to any optimization problem for which the ILP formulation consists of multicommodity flow equations as its core constraints. I.",

The performance measure of interest is schedule length, which directly affects both aggregate network throughput and average packet delay. Three different scheduling strategies are presented, namely: separate scheduling of unicast and multicast traffic, treating multicast traffic as a number of unicast messages, and treating unicast traffic as multicasts of size one. The strategies are compared against each other using extensive simulation experiments in order to establish the regions of operation, in terms of a number of relevant system parameters, for which each strategy performs best. Our main conclusions are as follows. Multi-cast traffic can be treated as unicast traffic under very limited circumstances. On the other hand, treating unicast traffic as multicast traffic produces short schedules in most cases. Alternatively, scheduling and transmitting each traffic component separately is also a good choice.",

Traffic grooming is a variant of the well-known logical topology design problem, and is concerned with the development of techniques for combining low speed traffic components onto high speed channels in order to minimize network cost. Previous studies have focused on aggregate representations of the network cost. In this work, we consider a Min\u2013Max objective, in which it is desirable to minimize the cost at the node where this cost is maximum. Such an objective is of high practical value when dimensioning a network for unknown future traffic demands and/or for dynamic traffic scenarios. We present new theoretical results which demonstrate that traffic grooming with the Min\u2013Max objective is NP-complete even when wavelength assignment is not an issue. We also present new polynomial-time traffic grooming algorithms for minimizing the \u2026",

The model is fairly general and allows each source-destination pair to service calls of different classes, with each call occupying one wavelength per link. Our approximate analytical approach involves two steps. The arrival process of calls on some routes is first modified slightly to obtain an approximate multiclass network model. Next, all classes of calls on a particular route are aggregated to give an equivalent single-class model. Thus, path decomposition algorithms for single-class wavelength routing networks may be readily extended to the multiclass case. This article is a first step towards  understanding the issues arising in wavelength routing networks that serve multiple classes of customers.",

The WF2Q+ scheduler we described in Section 10.2.1.4 implements both operations in time O(logn), where n is the number of flows served. Importantly, WF2Q+ closely emulates the ideal GPS fluid-flow scheduler, and thus it provides tight delay bounds to all flows and achieves a constant worst-case fair index. Although several timestampbased or hybrid scheduler variants have been developed with lower complexity, these schedulers provide looser delay and fairness guarantees than WF2Q+. As a result, the service received by individual flows under these simpler schedulers may be significantly different \u2026",

The static RWA arises in the network design phase where the objective is capacity planning and the sizing of network resources. The dynamic RWA is encountered during the real\u2010time network operation phase and involves the dynamic provisioning of optical connections. Both the static and dynamic variants of the problem are explored in depth with an emphasis on solution approaches and algorithms.

In this paper, we develop a new recursive decomposition approach for the RSA problem in optical networks. At the core of our approach is a new recursive branch and-bound procedure for carrying out an exhaustive search of the routing space in a scalable manner.

Distance adaptive spectrum allocation exploits the tradeoff between spectrum width and reach to improve resource utilization by tailoring the modulation format to the level of impairments along the path.

We first show that the DA-RSA problem in networks of general topology is a special case of a well-studied multiprocessor scheduling problem. We then leverage insights from scheduling theory to (1) present new results regarding the complexity of the DA-RSA problem, and (2) build upon list scheduling concepts to develop a computationally efficient solution approach that is effective in utilizing the available spectrum resources.",

            "Abstract": "Network service orchestration across heterogeneous networks needs an open marketplace where the services advertised by the providers in different domains can be purchased for short-term or long-term time scales. The authors present two design paradigms and evaluate two corresponding prototypes which provide a framework for network services to be purchased. They compare the two prototypes from the point of view of how effective they are in addressing some of the challenges posed by heterogeneous 5G networks namely programmability, scalability and innovation. They present a network service orchestration algorithm which is advertised as a network service in the marketplace.",

            "Abstract": "To bridge the gap between the current practice of setting up expensive, dedicated, lightpath connections (i.e., static topologies), and the distant future vision of inexpensive access to dynamically switched end-to-end lightpaths we propose a medium term solution in the form of edge-reconfigurable optical networks (ERONs). An ERON is an overlay-control network created by installing readily available MEMS optical switches and implementing a GMPLS control plane at sites interconnected by static lightpaths. The switches and control software are deployed at the edge of the network and operated by the organization-user (i.e., outside the network provider's control), hence the term ldquoERON.ldquo By providing dynamic, automated control of end-to-end lightpaths, ERONs enable the sharing of expensive network resources among multiple users and applications that require sporadic access to these resources.

Burst switching, as opposed to circuit or packet switching, implies that the network is capable of switching data in variable-sized parcels. Signaling is \"just-in-time\" indicating that signaling messages travel slightly ahead of the data they are describing. Signaling is out of band, with signaling packets undergoing electro-optical conversion at every hop. Data, on the other hand, travels transparently.",

Such techniques become increasingly important for emerging network technologies, including SONET/WDM rings and MPLS/MP/spl lambda/S backbones, for which traffic grooming is essential. In this article we formally define the traffic grooming problem, and we provide a general formulation that captures the features of a wide range of problem variants. We then present a comprehensive comparative survey of the literature that unveils the significant amount of research on this subject (the traffic grooming past). We also offer a broad set of ambitious research directions (the traffic grooming future) that are motivated by the exciting new challenges arising with the advent of MP/spl lambda/S technology.",

We propose link selection algorithms that reduce the size of the link-based ILP formulation for RWA by pruning redundant link decision variables. The resulting formulation scales well to mesh topologies representative of backbone and regional networks. In our experiments, the new formulation decreases the running time by more than two orders of magnitude without any impact on optimality. The link selection techniques are general in that they may be applied to any optimization problem for which the ILP formulation consists of multicommodity flow equations as its core constraints.",

            "Abstract": "Wavelength division multiplexing rings are now capable of supporting more than 100 wavelengths over a single fiber. Conventional link and path formulations for the routing and wavelength assignment problem are inefficient due to the inherent symmetry in wavelength assignment and the fact that the problem size increases fast with the number of wavelengths. Although a formulation based on maximal independent sets (MIS) does not have these drawbacks, it suffers from exponential growth in the number of variables with increasing network size. We develop a new ILP (integer linear program) formulation based on the key idea of partitioning the path set and representing the MIS in the original network using the independent sets calculated in each of these partitions. This exact decomposition trades off the number of variables with the number of constraints and, as a result, achieves a much better scalability in \u2026",

Based on this insight, we prove that, under the shortest path assumption, the SA problem can be solved in polynomial time in small rings, and we develop constant-ratio approximation algorithms for large rings.

Inspired by similar concepts in the airline industry, we decompose the network into clusters, and select a hub node in each cluster to groom traffic originating and terminating locally. At the second level of the hierarchy, the hub nodes form a virtual cluster for the purpose of grooming intra-cluster traffic. Clustering and hierarchical grooming enables us to cope with large network sizes and facilitates the control and management of traffic and network resources. Yet, determining the size and composition of clusters so as to yield good grooming solutions is a challenging task. We identify the grooming-specific factors affecting the selection of clusters, and we develop a parameterized clustering algorithm that can achieve a desired trade-off among various goals. We also obtain lower bounds on two important \u2026",

Second, we develop a recursive branch-and-bound algorithm to search the routing space exhaustively, yet in a scalable manner. We apply our method to a well-known intractable problem in optical networks, routing and spectrum assignment (RSA).

However, we have observed in simulations (using ns2) that buffer sizes in the range of interest for optical packet switched networks show unexpected behaviour: larger buffers can cause higher losses for open-loop (real-time) traffic when it multiplexes with closed-loop (TCP) traffic. In this short paper we develop a simplified Markov Chain model that helps explain this anomalous behaviour. The phenomenon observed in this paper can be of serious concern to all-optical packet switch designers and network service providers, who make huge investment in setting up the network infrastructure, but only to realise potentially degraded performance if appropriate care is not taken when dimensioning their router buffer sizes.",

Our approach can capture blocking due to handoffs for both satellite-fixed and Earth-fixed constellations.

The full virtual topology design problem is NP-hard even in the restricted case where the physical topology is a ring, and heuristics have been proposed in the literature. We present a new framework of bounds which can be used to evaluate the performance of heuristics, and which requires significantly less computation than evaluating the optimal solution. This framework consists of a sequence of bounds, both upper and lower, in which each successive bound is at least as strong as the previous one. The number of bounds to be evaluated for a given problem instance is only limited by the computational power available. The bounds are based on decomposing the ring into sets of nodes arranged in a path, and adopting the locally optimal topology within each set. While we only consider the objective of minimizing electronic routing in this paper, our approach to obtaining the sequence of bounds can be applied to many virtual topology problems on rings. The upper bounds we obtain also provide a useful series of heuristic solutions.",

Practices have been done profusely in order to find solutions for scheduling that nears optimality. A single scheduling mechanism may not always give the expected outcome. The task scheduling mechanisms are designed in a manner as to optimize some metrics related to the Cloud. This paper overviews various literature associated with task scheduling and resource scheduling in \u2026",

The objective of VTTR is to determine the minimum number of light-paths so as to satisfy a set of traffic demands, and does not take into account physical layer constraints; a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithm must reconcile the virtual topology obtained by VTTR with the physical topology. We propose an efficient algorithms that uses a partial LP relaxation technique with lazy constraints to improve substantially the scalability of VTTR, and, hence, of traffic grooming. Our approach delivers a desirable tradeoff between running time and quality of solution.",

            "Abstract": "In the past few years there has been vigorous debate regarding the size of buffers required at core Internet routers. Recent arguments supported by theory and experimentation show that under certain conditions, core router buffer sizes of a few tens of packets suffice for realizing acceptable end-to-end TCP throughputs. This is a significant step toward the realization of optical packet switched (OPS) networks, which are inherently limited in their ability to buffer optical signals. However, prior studies have largely ignored the presence of real-time traffic, which is increasing in importance as a source of revenue for Internet service providers. In this paper, we study the interaction that happens between real-time (open-loop) and TCP (closed-loop) traffic when they multiplex at buffers of very small size (few tens of packets) and make a significant discovery - namely that in a specific range of buffer size, real-time traffic losses \u2026",

One essential challenge is to allocate efficiently the bandwidth and computational resources to the service requests. In an online context, service chain requests may arrive, depart or evolve in an arbitrary fashion, adding more difficulty to the problem. Service chain reconfiguration may help improve the performance by individually rerouting a subset of the service chain requests. In this paper, we propose a new service chain reconfiguration framework to achieve load balancing in an NFV environment under varying levels of support from the underlying infrastructure. We show that our framework can achieve an approximation ratio of O(lnm/ln lnm) with high probability for the service chain request rerouting problem.",

In this paper, we present tiered-service fair queuing (TSFQ), a new scheduler that exploits certain properties of Internet traffic to speed up the bottleneck operations related to virtual time computation and packet sorting. Specifically, TSFQ makes innovative use of quantization (along the two dimensions of flow weights and packet lengths) her with specialized yet simple queuing structures. TSFQ combines all three properties that are important to a fair queuing algorithm, namely, a tight delay bound, worst-case fairness, and low complexity and amenability to hardware implementation. Hence, we believe that, for network operators, deploying TSFQ scheduling has the potential to enhance their ability to offer and guarantee a wide range of services.",

We propose new techniques that can effectively handle instances of congestion occurring simultaneously at various parts of a multicast tree.Our protocol incorporates several novel features: (1) hierarchical congestion status reports that distribute the load of processing feedback from all receivers across the multicast group, (2) the relative time delay concept which overcomes the difficulty of estimating round-trip times in tree \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Network function virtualization (NFV), with its perceived potential to accelerate service deployment and to introduce flexibility in service provisioning, has drawn a growing interest from industry and academia alike over the past few years. One of the key challenges in realizing NFV is the service chain routing problem, whereby traffic must be routed so as to traverse the various components of a network service that have been mapped onto the underlying network. In this work, we consider the online service chain routing problem. We route the service chain with the goal of jointly minimizing the maximum network congestion and the number of hops from the source to the destination. To this end, we present a simple yet effective online algorithm in which the routing decision is irrevocably made without prior knowledge of future requests. We prove that our algorithm is O(log m)-competitive in terms of congestion \u2026",

The enhancement, inspired by our earlier work in a related but different context, allows the optical line terminal (OLT) to perform look-ahead scheduling on each of the upstream channels. The look-ahead operation is fully compatible with the existing standard and may be implemented via software updates to the OLT without affecting the operation of optical network units in EPON. The look-ahead enhanced MPCP achieves significant performance gains across a wide range of traffic loads and opens up new opportunities for the design of sophisticated dynamic bandwidth algorithms to support advanced quality of service capabilities.",

            "Abstract": "Over the last few years we have witnessed a wide deployment of point-to-point wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission technology in the Internet infrastructure. The corresponding massive increase in network bandwidth due to WDM has heightened the need for faster switching at the core of the network. At the same time, there has been a growing effort to enhance the Internet protocol (IP) to support traffic engineering [1, 2] as well as different levels of quality of service (QoS)[3]. Label switching routers (LSRs) running multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)[4, 5] are being deployed to address the issues of faster switching, QoS support, and traffic engineering. On the one hand, label switching simplifies the forwarding function, thereby making it possible to operate at higher data rates. On the other hand, MPLS enables the Internet architecture, built on the connectionless Internet protocol, to behave in a connection-oriented fashion that is more conducive to supporting QoS and traffic engineering. The rapid advancement and evolution of optical technologies makes it possible to move beyond point-to-point WDM transmission systems to an all-optical backbone network that can take full advantage of the bandwidth available by eliminating the need for per-hop packet forwarding. Such a network consists of a number of optical cross-connects (OXCs) arranged in some arbitrary topology, and its main function is to provide interconnection to a number of IP/MPLS subnetworks. Each OXC can switch the optical signal coming in on a wavelength of an input fiber link to the same wavelength in an output fiber link. The OXC may also be equipped with \u2026",

Our contribution is two-fold. In the first part of the paper we settle the complexity of traffic grooming in path and star networks by proving that a number of variants of the problem are computationally hard. Since routing and wavelength assignment in these two topologies is trivial, these results demonstrate that traffic grooming is itself an inherently difficult problem. Our results have implications for ring and other more general topologies, which we explore. In the second part, we design practical grooming algorithms with provable properties.

Conventional link and path formulations for the RWA problem are inefficient due to the inherent symmetry in wavelength assignment and the fact that the problem size increases fast with the number of wavelengths. Although a formulation based on maximal independent sets (MIS) does not have these drawbacks, it suffers from the exponential growth in the number of variables with the increasing network size. We develop a new ILP formulation based on the idea of partitioning the path set and representing the maximal independent sets in the original network using the independent sets calculated in each of these partitions. This formulation trades off the number of variables with the number of constraints and, as a result, achieves a much better scalability in terms of network dimension.

We propose techniques that can effectively handle instances of both shortterm and persistent congestion occurring simultaneously at various parts of a multicast tree.

We take a traffic engineering approach to path selection in OBS networks with the objective of balancing the traffic across the network links to reduce congestion and to improve overall performance.

The logical topology design problem has been studied extensively in the literature [2]. Traffic grooming is a variant of the logical topology design problem, and is concerned with the development of techniques for combining low speed traffic components onto high speed channels in order to minimize network cost, and has received attention in recent literature [4, 3, 1, 6, 8]. In this paper we consider the problem of traffic grooming in path, star, and tree networks, which are useful topologies in themselves but are also building blocks for more general topologies. First, we settle the complexity of traffic grooming in path and star networks.

            "Abstract": "(OBS) networks employ shortest path routing along with nexthop burst forwarding. Shortest path routing minimizes delay and optimizes the utilization of resources, however, it often causes certain links to become congested while others remain underutilized. In a buffer-less OBS network in which burst drop probability is the primary metric of interest, the existence of a few highly congested links may lead to unacceptable performance for the entire network. In this paper, we take a traffic engineering approach to path selection in OBS networks with the objective of balancing the traffic across the network links in order to reduce congestion and improve overall performance. We present an approximate integer linear optimization problem, as well as a simple integer relaxation heuristic to solve the problem efficiently for large networks. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach is effective in reducing the network-wide burst drop probability, in many cases significantly, over shortest path routing.",

As the number of logical entities (including sub-wavelength channels, wavelengths, wavebands, and fibers) that need to be controlled in a multigranular network increases rapidly with the network size, wavelength capacity, and load, a scalable framework for managing these entities becomes a sine qua non for future wide area WDM networks. Several variants of the traffic grooming problem have been studied in the literature under a range of assumptions regarding the network topology, the nature of traffic, and the optical and electronic switching model [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

We develop and compare reconfiguration policies to determine  when to reconfigure the network, and we present an approach to carry out the network transition by describing a class of strategies that determine how to retune the optical transceivers. We identify the degree of load balancing and the number of retunings as two important, albeit conflicting, objectives in the design of reconfiguration policies, naturally leading to a formulation of the problem as a Markovian decision process.

In offering such a tiered bandwidth service, the operator must determine the number of tiers and the amount of bandwidth for each tier, as well as provision suffcient capacity within the network. Assuming that the provider has some information regarding the users' bandwidth requirements, it must balance two objectives in dimensioning its network for the tiered service: on the one hand, it must ensure that each user's bandwidth needs are adequately satisfied, while on the other hand it must minimize its own cost for providing the service.In this chapter we make the \u2026",

Such an architecture would use an economy plane to allow service providers and customers to exchange information about available service alternatives, complete purchase and payment interactions, and use purchased services.

We then consider bidirectional ring networks and investigate two problems: 1) the spectrum assignment problem under the assumption that each demand is routed along a single fixed path (e.g., the shortest path), and 2) the general case of the RSA problem whereby a routing decision along the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions must be made jointly with spectrum allocation. Based on insights from multiprocessor scheduling theory, we derive the complexity of the two problems and develop new constant-ratio approximation algorithms with a ratio that is strictly smaller than the best known ratio to date.",

In order to reduce the burst losses during the restoration process, effective fast restoration schemes are necessary. This is illustrated via two basic fast restoration schemes, the distributed deflection scheme and the local deflection scheme, compared with the slow global routing update mechanism. A novel priority-based QoS restoration scheme is also proposed to provide differentiated restoration services. Through detailed descriptive analysis and a comprehensive simulation study, these fast restoration schemes demonstrate fast restoration process, low fault management overheads, and excellent burst loss performance. As far as we know, this is the first comprehensive study on the restoration mechanisms for OBS networks.",
