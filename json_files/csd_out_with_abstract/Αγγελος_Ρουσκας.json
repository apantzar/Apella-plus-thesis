Public key infrastructure (PKI) and attribute certificates (ACs) can provide the appropriate framework to effectively support authentication and authorization services, offering mutual trust to both learners and service providers. Considering PKI requirements for online distance learning networks, this paper discusses the potential application of ACs in a proposed trust model. Typical e-learning trust interactions between e-learners and providers are presented, demonstrating that robust security mechanisms and effective trust control can be obtained and implemented. The application of ACs to support m-learning is also presented and evaluated through an experimental test-bed setup, using the general packet radio service \u2026",

Edge computing technology promises an increased quality of service with low communication delays by bringing the cloud closer to the end-users, at the network edge. The approach of placing server capabilities at access nodes, yielding edge service nodes, seems to be a feasible solution. In this way, proximity to service is achieved and guaranteed QoS is provided. However, keeping operational edge service nodes at every access node is energy consuming and yields increased operational expenses to the application provider when the requests for services are at low levels.

As the QoS of the demanding applications will still have to be preserved, more sophisticated schemes have to be employed in the admission control process so that providers will maintain their market share. Extending our previous work, we consider the existence of a visiting provider in the area, that can accept sessions from the home provider, to absorb overflow traffic due to instant lack of resources.

Consequently, cloud service providers, should not only attempt to provide competitive services to their customers, but also keep at the same time their operational costs at acceptable levels by minimizing energy consumption. The reduction of the number of active servers, using live virtual machine (VM) migrations, while keeping the system performance within the levels specified by the SLAs with customers, are main objectives of cloud service providers towards the above goals.

The CAC mechanism belongs to the well known family of guard channel schemes and reserves some code capacity to favor the continuation of handover (HO) calls over the new calls. During the handoff procedure the HO calls experience high delays as a number of packets have to be forwarded through the wireline infrastructure to the target cell. Thus, we employ a delay driven traffic scheduler (DDS) which aims to prioritize calls which experience high delays such as HO calls. Furthermore, DDS is able to exploit information from the physical layer in order to avoid erroneous packets transmissions and increases system performance. The \u2026",

To cope with this increase, mobile operators increment the number of base stations they are using resulting in an escalation of the corresponding energy footprint. This is why; the reduction of the total energy that is consumed from base stations has been the epicentre of many researchers. To achieve that, a common approach is to minimize the number of base stations that are used by activating only the necessary base stations without affecting the corresponding quality of service. In this paper, we present a method for predicting crowded areas based on machine learning techniques.

In this paper, we propose the inclusion of such information in SI by introducing modifications into the respective 3GPP specifications.

An unmovable DCH is defined as one which cannot be reallocated to another OVSF (orthogonal variable spreading factor) code because it is related to some service with very strict delay requirements. The relatively high total signaling delay for a single OVSF code reassignment makes the reallocation of such channels impractical. Therefore, a reassignment procedure that involves unmovable DCH channels cannot be performed. This is a very significant problem, since the complete elimination of code blocking is accomplished only if a code reassignment procedure can always be performed.

The users on the other hand will probably alter their behaviour towards the networks by making short-term commitments through ephemeral session-based subscriptions and requiring increased quality for the service they receive. In this upcoming environment, providers have to take into account in their admission control policies not only technical but also other parameters, like money revenue, reputation, and user satisfaction. We model the procedure of temporal session establishment as an extensive form game between the different parties involved, namely the provider, its current users, and the potential customer. The solution of this game produces an integrated pricing and admission control policy that achieves the network provider's optimum \u2026",

The DPA scheduler has low computational complexity and is able to provide QoS differentiation among traffic flows based on their delay sensitivity. Through the cross layer framework, DPA takes into account the variations of the wireless channel, and exploits processing gain to improve transmission quality and enable service provisioning when possible. Additionally, by providing a guaranteed rate per traffic flow at each scheduling period, DPA can offer a deterministic delay bound to each connection when transmissions are reliable.

            "Abstract": "Capacity overprovisioning in mobile networks leads to underutilization of network resources and thus inefficient operation from a power consumption perspective. In addition, as operators constantly evolve their networks to denser heterogeneous layouts, with overlaying macrocellular base stations coexisting with numerous smaller cells, to cope with upcoming increase in peak mobile data traffic, the energy consumption of mobile networks will continue to grow in the next years. In this context, although backhaul connections can be responsible for tremendous power consumption, the corresponding study is usually neglected in most of the recent energy related literature. An approach for fast and low cost connectivity of dense microcellular sites is the deployment of wireless in-band backhaul links via existing macrocellular base stations. In this paper, we consider this wireless in-band backhaul approach, where access and backhaul links share the same frequency spectrum, and examine joint energy efficient resource optimization on both links. We introduce an iterative low-complexity polynomial backhaul-aware heuristic, which directs traffic to the most energy efficient network resources, and compare it against i) an exhaustive search method that provides optimum results, ii) a previously proposed reference algorithm, and iii) ordinary Full Operational Topology (FOT) network, where no energy aware technique is applied. From the results obtained, we conclude that our heuristic achieves high energy efficiency gains in all scenarios examined, while wireless in-band backhaul method proved a solid choice for this purpose.",

One of the key requirements for smart city networks is mobility and this is the reason stable, reliable and high-quality wireless communications are needed in order to connect people and devices. Most research efforts so far, have used different kinds of wireless and sensor networks, making interoperability rather difficult to accomplish in smart cities. One common solution proposed in the recent literature is the use of software defined networks (SDNs), in order to enhance interoperability among the various heterogeneous wireless networks. In addition, SDNs can take advantage of the data retrieved from available sensors and use them as part of the intelligent decision making process contacted during the resource allocation procedure. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining heterogeneous wireless networks with social networks using SDNs. Specifically, we exploit the information retrieved from location based social networks regarding users\u2019 locations and we attempt to predict areas that will be crowded by using specially-designed machine learning techniques.

However, the employment of such robust security mechanisms in wireless realms enjoins additional research efforts due to several limitations of the radio-based connections, for example, link bandwidth and unreliability. This chapter will evaluate several Bluetooth personal area network (PAN) parameters, including absolute transfer times, link capacity, throughput, and goodput. Experiments shall \u2026",

            "Abstract": "High-speed packet access (HSPA) aims to advance the performance of the existing UMTS networks by improving the level of quality of service (QoS) and increasing the supported peak data rates at both the forward and the reverse link. HSPA consists of the HSDPA and high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) standards.AMC procedure of HSDPA makes possible the adaptation of the employed transport format and resource combination (TFRC) to the wireless channel variations as well as to the varying rate requirements of the UE. However, as the rate of the wireless channel variation increases, more frequent CQI reports by the UE to Node B are needed in order to have an efficient AMC. On the other hand, as the number of CQI reports increases, uplink interference also increases, thus reducing uplink reception quality. The authors of [1\u20133] propose a number of CQI schemes which aim to keep high the efficiency of AMC while at the same time reduce the required CQI information. In this paper, we propose a new CQI reporting scheme which reduces the required CQI signaling by exploiting a CQI prediction method based on an FSMC model of the wireless channel. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the CQI reporting procedure as it is determined by 3GPP specifications and subsequently we",

The communication among the VDT modules is achieved by the exchange of SOAP messages that implement events. Motivated by cross-system vertical handovers, the paper presents how such a handover is feasible in terms of VDT and which events are necessary for its realization.

            "Abstract": "Motivated by the fact that the SSL protocol has proved its effectiveness in wired IP networks, recent research work has examined the potential use of this protocol in various wireless technologies. Although Wi-Fi networks present security deficiencies, they manage to penetrate the wireless market to a great degree due to their low cost, easy administration, great capacity, IP-oriented nature, etc. Considering Wi-Fi networking settings, administrated by different operators, as parts of a common core 3G infrastructure, the author propose the potential application of enhanced SSL-based authentication mechanisms in integrated emerging-3G and Wi-Fi networks. Existing problems related to authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedures and the extensible authentication protocol (EAP)-AKA, as they appear in the latest 3G and integrated 3G/Wi-Fi specifications, are discussed. It is proposed how EAP-TLS, combined \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The evolution of wireless access networks has led to the vision of an integrated heterogeneous wireless environment consisting of various Radio Access Technologies (RATs). In such an environment, users with multimode terminals can seamlessly change from one RAT to another RAT attempting to maximize their satisfaction level, while providers may carefully utilize without overloading their subsystems. In this paper, we focus on the Network Selection problem to allocate terminals to most appropriate RATs by jointly examining both users and providers' preferences. We introduce a utility-based optimization function and formulate the terminal assignment problem as an optimization problem which is recognized as NP-hard. We propose a Greedy heuristic which exploits a metric that measures the utility gained versus the capacity resource spent for each allocation and confirm its superior performance against three \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Regional healthcare information networks have already started to grow across Europe, in order to cover local healthcare provision needs, especially in isolated regions, where there is often no availability of central general hospitals. The paper discusses a modelling and simulation framework for the design of regional healthcare information networks running compound medical and QoS\u2013sensitive applications. The proposed framework decomposes the compound medical applications into combinations of elementary traffic profiles, assesses appropriate values to the traffic parameters of the assigned models and defines suitable simulation scenarios. The simulation results are analysed and finally lead to reliable bandwidth estimations of the links of the healthcare information network under design. The proposed framework has been thoroughly validated through its application for the design of a healthcare network \u2026",

The power cost for operating this huge number of radio Base Stations (BSs) is under serious consideration by the mobile communication industry and recent research efforts have focused on energy efficient design and optimization of the radio access network in order to alleviate the energy consumption and mobile network operators OPEX. In this work, we consider a deployment of heterogeneous BSs to serve a given geographical area and propose two energy-aware algorithms to optimally determine the operational mode of those BSs under various traffic load conditions.

            "Abstract": "We consider the minimum span channel allocation problem encountered in cellular systems. Our solution approach is based on a set of sequential heuristics, and incorporates concepts borrowed from graph coloring schemes. The performance of the new heuristics has been tested on known benchmark problems, whose optimal solutions have been recently quoted in the literature. The new heuristics are quite effective in terms of speed, as well as in terms of spans produced. The results obtained are near-optimal in almost all cases, and certainly comparable to those produced by slower optimization procedures, indicating that these new variations can be treated either as an efficient alternative to this type of problems or as a very good starting point to more complicated procedures.",

A probabilistic approach is dedicated to solve the diagnosis problem, detecting malignancy among cases (instances) as derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) tests, while the second architecture estimates the time interval that possibly contains the right endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) of the patient. The accuracy of the neural classifiers reaches nearly 98% for the diagnosis and 93% for the prognosis problem, while the prognostic recurrence predictions were evaluated using survival analysis through the Kaplan-Meier approximation method. Both architectures were compared with other similar approaches. The robustness and real-time response of the proposed classifiers were further tested over the \u2026",
