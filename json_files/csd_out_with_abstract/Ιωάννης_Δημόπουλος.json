We investigated the possible correlation between APO1/Fas and both metabolic parameters and platelet activity (indicated by the MPV) in a healthy pediatric population.One hundred and eighty-five children, aged 5\u201317 years old, were enrolled in the study. The participants were divided into subgroups according to their age and body mass index percentile (BMI%).

            "Abstract": "In this work artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed to estimate meteorological data values in areas with sparse meteorological stations. A more traditional interpolation model (multiple regression model, MLR) is also used to compare model results and performance. The application site is a canyon in a National Forest located in southern Greece. Four meteorological stations were established in the canyon; the models were then applied to estimate air temperature values as a function of the corresponding values of one or more reference stations. The evaluation of the ANN model results showed that fair to very good air temperature estimations may be achieved depending on the number of the meteorological stations used as reference stations. In addition, the ANN model was found to have better performance than the MLR model: mean absolute error values were found to be in the range 0.82\u20131.72\u00b0C \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Modern agricultural practices used in greenhouse production are designed to produce compact, attractive and marketable plants by using plant growth regulators. These substances in combination to micrometeorological parameters affect the growth of ornamental plants. A chemical growth regulator, paclobutrazol, controls shoot extension and internode length by inhibiting gibberellin biosynthesis. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to report on micrometeorological data and biometrical measurements of gardenia plants under different solar radiation regimes in a greenhouse; and to apply simple statistical models to a time series of the micrometeorological and biometrical data in order to evaluate the combined effect of micrometeorological parameters and the application of paclobutrazol on the gardenia plant size. The experimental plants were grown under two radiation levels of about 250 W/m2 in an unshaded main plot R1 and 90 W/m2 in the R2 main plot shaded by polyester and aluminum artificial cover (Model LS-16 Opal of Ludving Svenson Co., The Netherlands). The plants were pinched at the second internode from the tips. The triazole paclobutrazol was applied once as a soil drench at the concentrations of 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/L on gardenia plants grown at both radiation levels four days after pinching. Results showed that during the first 20 days of growth period after the applications the size of gardenia plants grown at both radiation levels was affected by micrometeorological parameters while the action of paclobutrazol was not found to be important. However, from about the 21th to the 86th day the size of gardenia plants treated with \u2026",

Over recent years, data mining and machine learning led to the development of several efficient and accurate models for predicting of how long a patient will stay in the hospital and support healthcare policy planning. As an alternative to traditional classification methods, semi-supervised learning algorithms have become a hot topic of significant research which exhibit remarkable performance over labeled data but lack the ability to be applied on large amounts of unlabeled data. In this work, we evaluate the performance of semi-supervised methods in predicting the length of stay of hospitalized patients.

The evaluation of the performance is based on linear regression statistics and typical model statistical errors such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and the normalized objective function (NOF).

Gardenia plants were grown at three levels of solar irradiance (SI) achieved by shading materials and treated with paclobutrazol (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg lE-1) drenches after pinching. In addition, to assist in detecting certain trends in the micrometeorological and biometrical data, the cumulated function was used. Results showed that for the first 45 or 58 days after the applications with paclobutrazol, depending on SI level, the effect of paclobutrazol did not appear to be very pronounced, while the effect of micrometeorological parameters was found to be very important. On the other hand, results revealed that paclobutrazol was the predominant factor regulating plant height for the 45th-93rd day period and also for the 58th-116th day period, depending on SI level and for concentrations 5 mg lE-1.

For these reasons, a modification of the PaD (PaD2) was implemented to analyse the contribution of all possible pair-wise combinations of input variables, taking into account the two-way interactions between variables.In the present study, the PaD2 was applied firstly on synthetically generated data in order to test the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Various statistical models were developed for assessing airborne fluoride (F) levels in natural vegetation near an aluminum reduction plant using as predictor variables the distance from the emission source, the predominating wind, and characteristic topography-geomorphology parameters. Results revealed that F concentrations in vegetation showed a predictable response to both wind conditions and landscape features. The linear model was found to give good estimations, taking advantage of the relatively strong linear correlation between concentration and distance. A nonlinear relationship between the F concentration in vegetation and the other variables was also found, while interactions between the variables were found to be non-first-order. The nonlinear relationship hypothesis was supported by the improved results of various nonlinear models that also indicated the importance of the area\u2019s \u2026",

            "Abstract": "An artificial neural network (ANN) model-based approach was developed and applied to estimate values of air temperature and relative humidity in remote mountainous areas. The application site was the mountainous area of the Samaria National Forest canyon (Greece). Seven meteorological stations were established in the area and ANNs were developed to predict air temperature and relative humidity for the five most remote stations of the area using data only from two stations located in the two more easily accessed sites. Measured and model-estimated data were compared in terms of the determination coefficient (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE) and residuals normality. Results showed that R2 values range from 0.7 to 0.9 for air temperature and from 0.7 to 0.8 for relative humidity whereas MAE values range from 0.9 to 1.8 oC and 5 to 9%, for air temperature and relative humidity, respectively. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that ANNs, when adequately trained, could have a high applicability in estimating meteorological data values in remote mountainous areas with sparse network of meteorological stations, based on a series of relatively limited number of data values from nearby and easily accessed meteorological stations.",

            "Abstract": "In order to investigate transient performance problems in isolated power systems an accurate system dynamic model is required. Real measurements, under specific system operational conditions, have been used for the identification of the conventional generator unknown parameters. Frequency and power variations, resulting from the formulation model using the estimated parameters, are compared with the frequency and power deviations, measured during the corresponding real operational conditions in order to demonstrate the successful performance of the proposed methodology.",
