            "Abstract": "Location-based social sites, such as Foursquare or Yelp, are gaining increasing popularity. These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary in the form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled and concise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting the topic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help users make informed decisions, and also help venue owners personalize users\u2019 experiences. However, topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult, due to their short and fragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies, which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level, and we propose novel probabilistic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair. Our best topic model integrates influences from both venue inherent properties and user preferences, considering at the same the sentiment orientation of the users. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model compared to simpler models and previous work; they also show that venue-inherent properties have higher influences on the topics of micro-reviews.",

            "Abstract": "The problem of team formation in a social network asks for a set of individuals who not only have the required skills to perform a task but who can also communicate effectively with each other. Existing work assumes that all links in a social network are positive, that is, they indicate friendship or collaboration between individuals. However, it is often the case that the network is signed, that is, it contains both positive and negative links, corresponding to friend and foe relationships. Building on the concept of structural balance, we provide definitions of compatibility between pairs of users in a signed network, and algorithms for computing it. We then define the team formation problem in signed networks, where we ask for a compatible team of individuals that can perform a task with small communication cost. We show that the problem is NP-hard even when there are no communication cost constraints, and we provide heuristic algorithms for solving it. We present experimental results with real data to investigate the properties of the different compatibility definitions, and the effectiveness of our algorithms.",

Given that sequences in practice are too long, a quadratic algorithm is not an adequately fast solution. Here, we present an alternative constantfactor approximation algorithm with running time O(n4/3k5/3). We call this algorithm the DNS algorithm. We also consider the recursive application of the DNS algorithm, that results in a faster algorithm (O(n log log n) running time) with O(log n) approximation factor, and study the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff. Extensive experimental results show that these algorithms outperform other widely-used heuristics. The same algorithms can speed up solutions for other variants \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Nearest Neighbor Search problem is de ned as follows: given a set P of n points, preprocess the points so as to e ciently answer queries that require nding the closest point in P to a query point q. If we are willing to settle for a point that is almost as close as the nearest neighbor, then we can relax the problem to the approximate Nearest Neighbor Search. Nearest Neighbor Search (exact or approximate) is an integral component in a wide range of applications that include multimedia databases, computational biology, data mining, and information retrieval. The common thread in all these applications is similarity search: given a database of objects, we want to return the object in the database that is most similar to a query object. The objects are mapped onto points in a high dimensional metric space, and similarity search reduces to a nearest neighbor search. The dimension of the underlying space may be in the order of a few hundreds, or thousands; therefore, we require algorithms that perform e ciently even for spaces of high dimension. Due to its importance, the Nearest Neighbor Search problem has been a subject of research for many decades, and in many di erent elds. In this work we survey some of the past and recent results that marked the evolution of the problem. The report starts with the optimal solutions for low-dimensional spaces, then it goes through the solutions for the exact and approximate problem for spaces of arbitrary dimension, and then it nishes o with the recent attempts to prove lower bounds in order to specify the hardness of the problem.

Most previous work assumes that the underlying network is a static object that remains unchanged as the diffusion process progresses. However, there are several real-life networks that change dynamically over time. In this paper, we study diffusion on such evolving networks and extend the popular Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models to account for network evolution. In particular, we introduce two natural variations, a persistent and a transient one, to capture diffusions of different types. We consider the problem of influence maximization where the goal is to select a few influential nodes to initiate a diffusion with maximum spread. We show that, surprisingly, when considering evolving networks the diffusion function is no longer submodular for the transient models, and not even monotone for the transient Independent \u2026",

Interaction networks capture flow of data which is transferred between their vertices along a timeline. Analyzing such networks is crucial toward comprehend- ing processes in them. A typical analysis task is the finding of motifs, which are small subgraph patterns that repeat themselves in the network. In this paper, we introduce network flow motifs, a novel type of motifs that model significant flow transfer among a set of vertices within a constrained time window. We design an algorithm for identifying flow motif instances in a large graph. Our algorithm can be easily adapted to find the top-k instances of maximal flow. In addition, we design a dynamic programming module that finds the instance with the maximum flow. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on three real datasets and identify flow motifs which are significant for these graphs. Our results show that our algorithm is scalable and that the real networks indeed include interesting motifs, which appear much more frequently than in randomly generated networks having similar characteristics.",

This raises the question of how individual opinions evolve in such a networked environment without grounding in a known reality. The dominant approach to studying this problem uses simple models from the social sciences on how individuals change their opinions when exposed to their social neighborhood, and applies them on large social networks. We propose a novel model that incorporates two known social phenomena: (i) Biased Assimilation: the tendency of individuals to adopt other opinions if they are similar to their own; (ii) Backfire Effect: the fact that an opposite opinion may further entrench people in their stances, making their opinions more extreme instead of moderating them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DeGroot-type opinion formation model that captures the Backfire Effect. A thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of the proposed model reveals intuitive conditions for polarization and consensus to exist, as well as the properties of the resulting opinions.",

Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends, or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group towards a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting \u2026",

This structure was clearly revealed by Broder et al.[4] who presented the evocative bow-tie picture of the Web. Although, the bow-tie structure is a relatively clear abstraction of the macroscopic picture of the Web, it is quite uninformative with respect to the finer details of the Web graph. In this paper we mine the inner structure of the Web graph. We present a series of measurements on the Web, which offer a better understanding of the individual components of the bow-tie. In the process, we develop algorithmic techniques for performing these measurements. We discover that the scale-free properties permeate all the components of the bowtie which exhibit the same macroscopic properties as the Web graph itself. However, close inspection reveals that their inner structure is quite distinct. We show that the Web graph does not exhibit self similarity within its components, and we propose a possible alternative picture for the Web graph, as it emerges from our experiments.",

Micro-reviews are emerging as a new type of online review content in the social media. Micro-reviews are posted by users of check-in services such as Foursquare. They are concise (up to 200 characters long) and highly focused, in contrast to the comprehensive and verbose reviews. In this paper, we propose a novel mining problem, which brings together these two disparate sources of review content. Specifically, we use coverage of micro-reviews as an objective for selecting a set of reviews that cover efficiently the salient aspects of an entity. Our approach consists of a two-step process: matching review sentences to micro-reviews, and selecting a small set of reviews that cover as many micro-reviews as possible \u2026",

We describe an efficient method for computing the exact effect of a single edge insertion on the average shortest path length, as well as several heuristics for efficiently estimating this effect.

As user-generated reviews proliferate, it becomes critical to have a mechanism for helping the users (information consumers) deal with the information overload, and presenting them with a small comprehensive set of reviews that satisfies their information need. This is particularly important for mobile phone users, who need to make decisions quickly, and have a device with limited screen real-estate for displaying the reviews. Previous approaches have addressed the problem by ranking reviews according to their (estimated) helpfulness. However, such approaches do not account for the fact that the top few high-quality reviews may be highly redundant, repeating the same information, or presenting the same positive (or negative) perspective.

Working within the framework of Borodin et al.[7], we prove that on this class (a) the Hits algorithm is stable with high probability, and (b) the Hits algorithm is similar to the InDegree heuristic that assigns to each node weight proportional to the number of incoming links. We demonstrate that our results go through for the case that the expected in-degrees of the graph follow a power-law distribution, a situation observed in the actual Web graph [9].

Given two instances of the graph at two points in time, we ask to identify the top pairs of nodes whose shortest path distance has decreased the most. We call these pairs converging. The straightforward way to address this problem is by computing the shortest path distances of all pairs at both instances and keeping the ones with the largest differences. Since for large networks this is computationally infeasible, we consider a budgeted version of the problem, where given a fixed budget of single-source shortest path computations, we seek to identify nodes that participate in as many converging pairs as possible. We evaluate a number of different approaches for our problem, that employ centrality-based, dispersion-based, and landmark-based distance estimation metrics. We also consider a classification-based approach that builds a classifier that combines the above features for predicting whether a node participates in one of the top converging pairs. We present experimental results using realworld datasets that show that we are able to identify the large majority of the top converging pairs on a very small budget.",

Moreover, the tests are difficult to apply to sets of patterns or other complex results of data mining algorithms. In this article, we consider a simple randomization technique that deals with this shortcoming. The approach consists of producing random datasets that have the same row and column margins as the given dataset, computing the results of interest on the randomized instances and comparing them to the results on the actual data.

In this paper we study the problem of finding subsets of points with low intrinsic dimensionality. Our main contribution is to extend the definition of fractal correlation dimension, which measures average volume growth rate, in order to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the data in local neighborhoods. We provide a careful analysis of several key examples in order to demonstrate the properties of our measure. Based on our proposed measure, we introduce a novel approach to discover clusters with low dimensionality. The resulting algorithms extend previous density based measures, which have been \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Despite the pleiotropic effects of the progesterone receptor in breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms in play remain largely unknown. To gain a global view of the PR-orchestrated networks, we used next-generation sequencing to determine the progestin-regulated transcriptome in T47D breast cancer cells. We identify a large number of PR target genes involved in critical cellular programs, such as regulation of transcription, apoptosis, cell motion and angiogenesis. Integration of the transcriptomic data with the PR-binding profiling of hormonally treated cells identifies numerous components of the small-GTPases signaling pathways as direct PR targets. Progestin-induced deregulation of the small GTPases may contribute to the PR's role in mammary tumorigenesis. Transcript expression analysis reveals significant expression changes of specific transcript variants in response to the extracellular hormonal stimulus. Using the NET1 gene as an example, we show that the PR can dictate alternative promoter usage leading to the upregulation of an isoform that may play a role in metastatic breast cancer. Future studies should aim to characterize these selectively regulated variants and evaluate their clinical utility in prognosis and targeted therapy of hormonally responsive breast tumors.",

In this paper, we undertake a theoretical analysis of the properties of the HITS algorithm on a broad class of random graphs. Working within the framework of Borodin et al.

We demonstrate that our results go through for the case that the expected in-degrees of the graph follow a power law distribution.

            "Abstract": "Clustering is a problem of great practical importance in numerous applications. The problem of clustering becomes more challenging when the data is categorical, that is, when there is no inherent distance measure between data values. We introduce LIMBO, a scalable hierarchical categorical clustering algorithm that builds on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for quantifying the relevant information preserved when clustering. As a hierarchical algorithm, LIMBO has the advantage that it can produce clusterings of different sizes in a single execution. We use the IB framework to define a distance measure for categorical tuples and we also present a novel distance measure for categorical attribute values. We show how the LIMBO algorithm can be used to cluster both tuples and values. LIMBO handles large data sets by producing a memory bounded summary model for the data. We present an \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Location-based social networks (LBSNs), exemplified by Foursquare, are fast gaining popularity. One important feature of LBSNs is micro-review. Upon check-in at a particular venue, a user may leave a short review (up to 200 characters long), also known as a tip. These tips are an important source of information for others to know more about various aspects of an entity (e.g., restaurant), such as food, waiting time, or service. However, a user is often interested not in one particular entity, but rather in several entities collectively, for instance within a neighborhood or a category. In this paper, we address the problem of summarizing the tips of multiple entities in a collection, by way of synthesizing new micro-reviews that pertain to the collection, rather than to the individual entities per se. We formulate this problem in terms of first finding a representation of the collection, by identifying a number of \u201caspects\u201d that \u2026",

In this work, we consider fairness for link analysis algorithms and in particular for the celebrated PageRank algorithm. We provide definitions for fairness, and propose two approaches for achieving fairness. The first modifies the jump vector of the Pagerank algorithm to enfonce fairness, and the second imposes a fair behavior per node. We also consider the problem of achieving fairness while minimizing the utility loss with respect to the original algorithm. We present experiments with real and synthetic graphs that examine the fairness of Pagerank and demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively the properties of our algorithms.",

In this paper we take a novel approach to the trolling problem: our goal is to identify the targets of the trolls, so as to prevent trolling before it happens. We thus define the troll vulnerability prediction problem, where given a post we aim at predicting whether it is vulnerable to trolling. Towards this end, we define a novel troll vulnerability metric of how likely a post is to be attacked by trolls, and we construct models for predicting troll-vulnerable posts, using features from the content and the history of the post.

For example, a highly-recommended restaurant may match the preferences of many users. However, increasing its popularity via recommendations may make the experience unsatisfactory due to high volume of customers, long lines and inevitably slow service. In this paper, we develop a new recommendation-system paradigm that we call collective recommendations. Collective recommendations take into consideration not only the user preferences, but also the effect of the popularity of a venue to the overall user experience.

In this paper, we study whether clicks can be used to automatically generate good labels. Intuitively, documents that are clicked (resp., skipped) in aggregate can indicate relevance (resp., lack of relevance). We give a novel way of transforming clicks into weighted, directed graphs inspired by eye-tracking studies and then devise an objective function for finding cuts in these graphs that induce a good labeling. In its full generality, the problem is NP-hard, but we show that, in the case of two labels, an optimum labeling can be found in linear time. For the more general case, we propose heuristic solutions. Experiments on real click logs show that \u2026",

For a given structured data source, a fundamental problem in supporting faceted search is finding an ordered selection of attributes and values that will populate the facets. This creates two sets of challenges. First, because of the limited screen real-estate, it is important that the top facets best match the anticipated user intent.

In this paper, we consider the problem of measuring and reducing polarization of opinions in a social network.

In this paper, we investigate the question of stability of multiclass queueing networks within the adversarial queueing theory model, where workload is induced by an adversary. Prior work in the adversarial model considers only a special case of queueing networks, where all customers require unit service times. We extend this model to include more general queueing networks, where the customers may require di erent service times at di erent servers of the network. We prove that, unlike the previous model, in the generalized model, the unidirectional ring topology is no longer universally stable (stable against all adversaries). Nevertheless, the queueing policies proven to be universally stable for the previous model, remain universally stable in the generalized adversarial model. We also de ne four new queueing policies that are natural generalizations of the queueing policies for the new model, and we examine their stability.",

In this paper, we introduce the flow computation problem between two vertrices in an interaction network. We propose and study two models of flow computation, one based on a greedy flow transfer assumption and one that finds the maximum possible flow. We show that the greedy flow computation problem can be easily solved by a single scan of the interactions in time order. For the harder maximum flow problem, we propose precomputation and simplification approaches that can greatly reduce its complexity in practice. We also approach the problem of flow \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Cyberaggression has been found in various contexts and online social platforms, and modeled on different data using state-of-the-art machine and deep learning algorithms to enable automatic detection and blocking of this behavior. Users can be influenced to act aggressively or even bully others because of elevated toxicity and aggression in their own (online) social circle. In effect, this behavior can propagate from one user and neighborhood to another, and therefore, spread in the network. Interestingly, to our knowledge, no work has modeled the network dynamics of aggressive behavior. In this paper, we take a first step towards this direction, by studying propagation of aggression on social media. We look into various opinion dynamics models widely used to model how opinions propagate through a network. We propose ways to enhance these classical models to accommodate how aggression may propagate from one user to another, depending on how each user is connected to other aggressive or regular users. Through extensive simulations on Twitter data, we study how aggressive behavior could propagate in the network. We validate the models with ground truth crawled and annotated data, reaching up to 80% AUC. We discuss the results and implications of our work.",

            "Abstract": "Clustering is a problem of great practical importance in numerous applications. The problem of clustering becomes more challenging when the data is categorical, that is, when there is no inherent distance measure between data values. In this work, we introduce LIMBO, a scalable hierarchical categorical clustering algorithm that builds on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for quantifying the relevant information preserved when clustering. We use the IB framework to define a distance measure for categorical tuples and we also present a novel distance measure for categorical attribute values. We show how the LIMBO algorithm can be used to cluster both tuples and attribute values. LIMBO handles large data sets by producing a summary model for the data. We propose two different versions of LIMBO, where we either control the size or the accuracy of the model. We present an experimental evaluation of both versions of LIMBO, and we study how clustering quality in information theoretic clustering algorithms compares to other categorical clustering algorithms. LIMBO also supports a tradeoff between efficiency (in terms of space and time). We quantify this trade-off and we demonstrate that LIMBO allows for substantial improvements in efficiency with negligible decrease in quality. LIMBO is a hierarchical algorithm that produces clusterings for a range of k values (where k is the number of clusters). We take advantage of this feature to examine heuristics for selecting good clusterings (with natural values of k) within this range.",

            "Abstract": "Online reviews in which users publish detailed commentary about their experiences and opinions with products, services, or events are extremely valuable to users who rely on them to make informed decisions. However, reviews vary greatly in quality and are constantly increasing in number, therefore, automatic assessment of review helpfulness is of growing importance. Previous work has addressed the problem by treating a review as a stand-alone document, extracting features from the review text, and learning a function based on these features for predicting the review quality. In this work, we exploit contextual information about authors' identities and social networks for improving review quality prediction. We propose a generic framework for incorporating social context information by adding regularization constraints to the text-based predictor. Our approach can effectively use the social context information \u2026",

In this vision paper, we make the case for a systematic approach towards measuring bias. To this end, we discuss formal measures for quantifying the various types of bias, we outline the system components necessary for realizing them, and we highlight the related research challenges and open problems.",

            "Abstract": "Classification is a core task in knowledge discovery and data mining, and there has been substantial research effort in developing sophisticated classification models. In a parallel thread, recent work from the NLP community suggests that for tasks such as natural language disambiguation even a simple algorithm can outperform a sophisticated one, if it is provided with large quantities of high quality training data. In those applications, training data occurs naturally in text corpora, and high quality training data sets running into billions of words have been reportedly used.",

            "Abstract": "Recommender systems have been applied successfully in a number of different domains, such as, entertainment, commerce, and employment. Their success lies in their ability to exploit the collective behavior of users in order to deliver highly targeted, personalized recommendations. Given that recommenders learn from user preferences, they incorporate different biases that users exhibit in the input data. More importantly, there are cases where recommenders may amplify such biases, leading to the phenomenon of bias disparity. In this short paper, we present a preliminary experimental study on synthetic data, where we investigate different conditions under which a recommender exhibits bias disparity, and the long-term effect of recommendations on data bias. We also consider a simple re-ranking algorithm for reducing bias disparity, and present some observations for data disparity on real data.",

            "Abstract": "Teams that bring together experts with different expertise are important for solving complex problems. However, research shows that teaming up people simply based on their ability is not enough. Team members need to have clear roles, and they should mutually endorse and respect their teammates for the role they assume on the team. In this paper, we define the MaxMutualRespect problem, a novel team-formation problem that asks for a set of experts, each assigned to a distinct role, such that the total respect that the individuals receive by the rest of the team members for their assigned role is maximized. We show that the problem is NP-complete and we consider approximation and heuristic algorithms. Experiments with real datasets demonstrate that our problem definitions and algorithms work well in practice and yield intuitive results.",
