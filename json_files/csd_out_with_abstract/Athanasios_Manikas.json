            "Abstract": "A number of significant problems, arising frequently in array signal processing, have been successfully tackled using methods based on the concept of the array manifold. These approaches take advantage of the inherent information about the array system which is encapsulated in the geometry of the array manifold. Array ambiguities, array uncertainties, array design and performance characterization are just some of the areas that have benefited from this approach. However, the investigation of the geometry of the array manifold itself for most array geometries has been proven to be a complex problem, especially when higher order geometric properties need to be calculated. Nevertheless, special array geometries have been identified, for which the array manifold curve assumes a specific \u201chyperhelical\u201d shape. This property of the array manifold greatly simplifies its geometric analysis and, consequently, the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "By using the manifold separation techniques, root-MUSIC designed for uniform linear arrays has been extended to arbitrary geometries at the cost of increased computational complexity. A fast algorithm is proposed that exploits the Laurent structure of the polynomial to conduct fast spectral factorisation via the Schur algorithm. Then Arnoldi iteration is employed to compute only a few of the largest eigenvalues. This implies that a large number of the unwanted eigenvalues (or roots) are exempt from the calculation and therefore the computational complexity is reduced significantly.",

The antenna array can be rigid (fixed array locations) or flexible (time-varying array locations), and it is used in conjunction with a manifold extender, a spatiotemporal state-space model and a Kalman-type tracking approach for non-stationary wireless channels.

This acoustic energy may be generated by the feature under study itself (such as a marine animal) or be a reflected signal emitted by an acoustic source (such as a sparker or boomer). The major challenge in towed array processing is the receiver positional uncertainties resulting from the array's flexible structure in combination with the ship's turning maneuvers or water currents. These uncertainties can cause a significant reduction in the performance of the receiver array of hydrophones.

By rotating the array reference point to be at each of the array sensors, a number of covariance matrices are constructed. It is shown that the eigenvalues of these covariance matrices are related to the source location with respect to the array reference point. The proposed approach is robust to channel fading and considers both wideband and narrowband assumptions.

This allows the creation of higher resolution images when compared to real aperture radar (RAR), where the radar system is stationary during data collection. Therefore, SAR has been used in many remote sensing applications including geographic mapping, ocean surveillance and ground moving target indication (GMTI), to name but a few.

First, a novel spherical-spatiotemporal-state-space model is introduced incorporating target ranges, directions, and Doppler effects in conjunction with the array geometry. Subsequently, this array of sensors is integrated with an extended Kalman filter (EKF), defined as the arrayed EKF, to track the trajectory of multiple mobile sources. In addition, a recursive lower bound on the performance of the proposed tracking method is obtained based on the posterior Cramer-Rao bound. Computer simulation studies show that the proposed approach can track the locations of sources, as these move in space, with a very high accuracy.",

This study is mainly focused on uncertainties on the positions of the antenna array elements, which also reflect uncertainties in the carrier frequency. Such uncertainties are inherent in the manufacturing process of antenna arrays and can greatly impact on system performance. Their effects on various performance measures such as the accuracy of channel parameter estimation and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of a number of receivers that employ antenna arrays is studied. The results of the study are particularly applicable to array design and calibration methods.",

This is in contrast with conventional MIMO systems, which typically assume multiple independent antenna elements at the transmitters and receivers. This paper focuses on an arrayed-MIMO communication system operating over a frequency-selective fading channel and employs MC-CDMA as the modulation scheme. However, in a departure from conventional MC-CDMA systems, cyclic prefixes or guard intervals are not used for the MC-CDMA system employed here so that valuable bandwidth is not wasted on cyclic prefixes or guard intervals. The feasibility of the proposed system is supported by simulation results.",

Moreover the multipaths that define the channel are spatially and temporally diffused such that each multipath appears as a cluster rather than a point like signal source. Hence, channel estimation techniques that do not exploit the structure of the vector channel become inefficient. In this context, a subspace approach to estimate the diffused vector channels for multi-user wideband DS-CDMA systems is being proposed. The diffused vector channel is parameterized in terms of multipath directions and times of arrival. Then, by employing the structure of the developed diffused vector channel, a powerful blind near-far resistant channel estimation algorithm is derived. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "The issue of resolving manifold ambiguities in subspace-based Direction Finding (DF) systems is investigated in this paper. The cause of manifold ambiguities is due to linear dependence amongst manifold vectors. When an ambiguous situation occurs, subspace-based DF techniques fail to correctly identify a unique set of Directions-of-Arrival (DOA). This causes a performance degradation due to unreliable estimates of the parameters. In spite of the fact that there are infinitely many ambiguous scenarios in an array system, the problem in resolving manifold ambiguities has received very little attention. In this paper, two novel techniques are proposed, aiming at improving the DOA identification capability, while maintaining a minimum computational complexity. The proposed techniques adopt a beamforming class based on the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) criterion to estimate signal power \u2026",

The array orientation, number of sensors and phase characteristics of the virtual array are a function of the array shape of the planar array. The two parameter manifold (azimuth, elevation) of a planar array of N sensors is a conoid surface embedded into an N-dimensional complex space which can be described by two families of curves (\u03b8-curves and \u03c6-curves). While the family of \u03c6-curves have hyperhelical shape, the family of \u03b8curves do not. The proposed transformation will allow the \u03b8curves to be transformed to the manifold of a virtual ULA that has hyperhelical shape. This will allow a planar array system to be analysed or designed by analysing or designing simple hyperhelical curves associated with the virtual linear array.",

In order to fully exploit the arrayed MIMO configuration, a \u2018virtual\u2019array approach is taken, whereby the combined transmit-receive MIMO geometry is expressed as an equivalent Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) radar system. Contrary to existing descriptions of the virtual array, the model derived in this paper does not rely upon the use of a specific algorithm at the receiver and is valid for non-stationary targets whose echoes arriving from different ranges are unsynchronised. As such, this model is more general and a number of results are presented detailing the fundamental performance capabilities of the virtual SIMO system.A space-time receiver architecture is proposed which exploits the virtual SIMO structure as part of a subspace-based parameter estimation framework. Due to the great computational burden of an exhaustive 3-parameter search, the joint Dopplerdelay-DOA estimation is partitioned into an equivalent two-stage algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated via computer simulation studies and shown to outperform existing methods.",
