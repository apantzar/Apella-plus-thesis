            "Abstract": "In this chapter, we highlight the process of border revision, which plays a significant role on both border-based and exact approaches for association rule hiding. Simply stated, the process of border revision captures those itemsets of the original database which need to remain frequent and those that need to become infrequent in the sanitized version of the database, in order to allow furnishing an optimal hiding solution. After presenting the theory behind border revision, we introduce a set of algorithms (adopted from [27]) that can be applied for the efficient computation of both the original and the revised borders in a transactional database, when given a minimum support threshold.",

            "Abstract": "Large repositories of data contain sensitive information which must be protected against unauthorized access. Recent advances, in data mining and machine learning algorithms, have increased the disclosure risks one may encounter when releasing data to outside parties. A key problem, and still not sufficiently investigated, is the need to balance the confidentiality of the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the data users. Every disclosure limitation method affects, in some way, and modifies true data values and relationships. In this paper, we investigate confidentiality issues of a broad category of rules, which are called association rules. If the disclosure risk of some of these rules are above a certain privacy threshold, those rules must be characterized as sensitive. Sometimes, sensitive rules should not be disclosed to the public since, among other things, they may be used for inferencing sensitive \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, privacy preserving data mining is an increasingly popular field of data mining research. frequent itemset-based approaches comprise a large category of techniques where the hiding is exemplified through the Apriori algorithm. This paper extends the work on a previously presented hiding scheme that sanitizes the input database by extending it based on the ideal positive border that is computed through the application of a constraint-based frequent itemset mining algorithm. The goal of the proposed approach is to improve at large on computational aspects of the hiding methodology, and in particular to accommodate bigger datasets by customizing the hiding scheme and allowing it to run in parallel while ensuring the hiding of the sensitive knowledge in its entirety. The proposed approach is a significant acceleration factor provided to business user directly in the form of Software as a Service.",

But as data on the Web grew larger in numbers, so did the perils due to the applications of data mining. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) is the field that investigates techniques to preserve the privacy of data and patterns. Knowledge Hiding, a subfield of PPDM, aims at preserving the sensitive patterns included in the data, which are going to be published. A wide variety of techniques fall under the umbrella of Knowledge Hiding, such as frequent pattern hiding, sequence hiding, classification rule hiding and so on.",

            "Abstract": "Privacy-preserving record linkage is a very important task, mostly because of the very sensitive nature of the personal data. The main focus in this task is to find a way to match records from among different organisation data sets or databases without revealing competitive or personal information to non-owners. Towards accomplishing this task, several methods and protocols have been proposed. In this work, we propose a certain methodology for preserving the privacy of various record linkage approaches and we implement, examine and compare four pairs of privacy preserving record linkage methods and protocols. Two of these protocols use n-gram based similarity comparison techniques, the third protocol uses the well known edit distance and the fourth one implements the Jaro-Winkler distance metric. All of the protocols used are enhanced by private key cryptography and hash encoding. This paper presents \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a wavelet-based methodology for performing privacy preserving record linkage. The proposed methodology is introduced in a bottom-up approach, starting from simple text matching and extending to actual record linkage. The discrete wavelet transform, along with some privacy preserving operations, is employed to cast text into a numerical sequence of fixed length. Database records are then treated as collections of such numerical sequences. Practical examples and implementation details are provided during all development phases. The method is applied on simulated data of bibliographic records, and results demonstrate that performance is comparable to other successful methodologies.",

Among the different solution approaches that have been proposed to tackle this problem, K-anonymity has received increased attention and has been extensively studied in various forms. New forms of data that come into existence, like location data capturing user movement, pave the way for the offering of cutting edge services such as the prevailing Location Based Services (LBSs). Given that these services assume an in-depth knowledge of the mobile users' whereabouts it is certain that the assumed knowledge may breach the privacy of the users. Thus, concrete approaches are necessary to preserve the anonymity of the mobile users when requesting LBSs. In this work, we survey recent advancements for the offering of K-anonymity in LBSs.

We also present the formalism used (the Mnemosyne\u2019s Kanon) and also the particularities of the Greek language that hinder the computational processing. Given that the major problem of modern Greek is the lexical ambiguity we designed the Greek tagger grounded on linguistic criteria for those cases where the lexical ambiguity impede the imprint of the errors in Greek language. The texts that were given for correction to the grammar checker were also corrected by a person. In a very large percentage the grammar checker approximates in accuracy the human-corrector.",

            "Abstract": "In this era of significant advances in telecommunications and GPS sensors technology, a person can be tracked down to proximity of less than 5 meters. This remarkable progress enabled the offering of services that depend on user location (the so-called location-based services\u2014LBSs), as well as the existence of applications that analyze movement data for various purposes. However, without strict safeguards, both the deployment of LBSs and the mining of movement data come at a cost of privacy for the users, whose movement is recorded. This chapter studies privacy in both online and offline movement data. After introducing the reader to this field of study, we review state-of-the-art work for location and trajectory privacy both in LBSs and in trajectory databases. Then, we present a qualitative evaluation of these works, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses. We conclude the chapter by providing our point \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Sun & Yu [66, 67] in 2005 proposed the first frequent itemset hiding methodology that relies on the notion of the border [46] of the nonsensitive frequent itemsets to track the impact of altering transactions in the original database. By evaluating the impact of each candidate item modification to the itemsets of the revised positive border, the algorithm greedily selects to apply those modifications (item deletions) that cause the least impact to the border itemsets. As already covered in the previous chapter, the border itemsets implicitly dictate the status (i.e., frequent vs. infrequent) of every itemset in the database. Consequently, the quality of the borders directly affects the quality of the sanitized database that is produced by the hiding algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "Performing approximate data matching has always been an intriguing problem for both industry and academia. This task becomes even more challenging when the requirement of data privacy rises. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to address the problem of efficient privacy-preserving approximate record linkage. The secure framework we propose consists of two basic components. First, we utilize a secure blocking component based on phonetic algorithms statistically enhanced to improve security. Second, we use a secure matching component where actual approximate matching is performed using a novel private approach of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm. Our goal is to combine the speed of private blocking with the increased accuracy of approximate secure matching.",

            "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel constraint-based hiding model to drastically reduce the preprocessing overhead that is incurred by border-based techniques in the hiding of sensitive frequent itemsets. The proposed model is solved by an efficient constraint-based mining algorithm that pushes a conjunction of antimonotone constraints into an Apriori-like algorithm, for inducing the support theory of non-sensitive frequent itemsets along with its negative border. The patterns induced by the constraint-based mining algorithm can be used in border-based hiding algorithms to construct a sanitized version of the original database, where the sensitive knowledge is concealed. The efficiency of the constraint-based mining algorithm is evaluated on real and synthetic datasets.",

            "Abstract": "In this chapter, we present in detail the first algorithm that has been proposed which does not rely on any heuristics to secure the sensitive knowledge derived by association rule mining. Similarly to Menon\u2019s algorithm (covered in Chapter 13), the inline algorithm of [23] aims to hide the sensitive frequent itemsets of the original database  that can lead to the production of sensitive association rules. As a first step, we will introduce the notion of distance between two databases along with a measure for quantifying it. The quantification of distance provides us with important knowledge regarding the minimum data modification that is necessary to be induced to the original database to facilitate the hiding of the sensitive itemsets, while minimally affecting the nonsensitive ones. By trying to minimize the distance between the original database and its sanitized counterpart, the inline algorithm formulates the hiding \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Data sharing among organizations has become an increasingly common procedure in several areas such as advertising, marketing, electronic commerce, banking, and insurance sectors. However, any organization will most likely try to keep some patterns as hidden as possible once it shares its datasets with others. This paper focuses on preserving the privacy of sensitive patterns when inducing decision trees. We adopt a record augmentation approach to hide critical classification rules in binary datasets. Such a hiding methodology is preferred over other heuristic solutions like output perturbation or cryptographic techniques, which limit the usability of the data, since the raw data itself is readily available for public use. We propose a look ahead technique using linear Diophantine equations to add the appropriate number of instances while maintaining the initial entropy of the nodes. This method can be used to hide one or more decision tree rules optimally. View Full-Text",

Although many methods have been proposed in the literature for encoding strings, the problem of encoding numerical values has not been effectively addressed yet. In Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL), a number of data custodians encode their records and submit them to a trusted third-party that is responsible to identify those records that refer to the same real-world entity. BV is supported by a strong theoretical foundation for embedding numerical values into an anonymization space in a way that preserves the initial distances. Key components of this embedding process are (a) the employed hash functions which, by utilizing random intervals, they allow for approximate matching, and (b) the threshold that is required by the distance \u2026",

The latter can be explained as a mismatch between real world objects and the way they are represented in databases. The former, as it is exemplified by data heterogeneity-semantic and structural-replicated data, and data integrity problems, is the main cause of duplicate records. Often the same real world entity is represented by two or more records. Many times, duplicate records do not share a common key and/or they contain errors that makes matching them a difficult problem. This specific problem is the subject of this expository study.

The purpose of this study is to analyse data related to the participation of postgraduate students in the online forum of their course at the Hellenic Open University. The content of the messages posted is analysed by using text mining techniques, while the network through which the students interact is processed through social network analysis techniques. Furthermore, sentiment analysis and opinion mining is applied on the same dataset. Our aim is to study students\u2019 attitude towards the course and its features, as well as to model their sentiment behaviour over time, and finally to detect if and how this affected their overall performance. The combined knowledge attained from the aforementioned techniques can provide tutors with practical and valuable information for the structure and the content of the students\u2019 exchanged messages, the patterns of interaction among them, the trend of sentiment polarity during the course, so as to improve the educational process.",

            "Abstract": "A wide range of methodologies have been proposed in research literature to effectively shield the sensitive information contained in a dataset by producing its privacy-aware counterpart that can be safely released. The goal of these privacy preserving methodologies is to ensure that the sanitized dataset (a) properly shields all the sensitive information that was contained in the original dataset and (b) has properties similar to the original dataset, eg, first/second order statistics, etc., possibly resembling it to a high extent, and (c) maintains",

Data cleaning problems are frequently encountered in many research areas, such as kllowledge discovery in databases, data warellOusing. system imegratioll and eservices. The process of identifying the record pairs that represent the same entity (duplicate records), commonly known as record linkage, is one of the essential elements of data cleaning. In this paper, we address the record linkage problem by adopting a machine learning approach. Three models are proposed and are analyzed empirically. Since no existing model, including those proposed in lh is paper, has been proved to be superior, we have developed an interactive Record Linkage Toolbox named TAILOR. Users of TAILOR can build their own record linkage models by tuning system parameters and by plugging in in-house developed and public \u2026",

For each item of a sensitive itemset, the Max\u2013Min algorithms identify the set of itemsets from the revised positive border which depend on it, and select among them the ones that are supported the least.

We achieve highly accurate results and simultaneously reduce significantly the computational cost by minimizing the number of distance computations performed. Our scheme provides theoretical guarantees for identifying the similar anonymized record pairs by conducting redundant blocking and by performing a distance computation only if the corresponding anonymized record pair is formulated a specified number of times. A series of experiments illustrate the efficacy of our scheme in identifying the similar record pairs, while simultaneously keeping the running time exceptionally low.",

            "Abstract": "The task of linking multiple databases with the aim to identify records that refer to the same entity is occurring increasingly in many application areas. If unique identifiers for the entities are not available in all the databases to be linked, techniques that calculate approximate similarities between records must be used for the identification of matching pairs of records. Often, the records to be linked contain personal information such as names and addresses. In many applications, the exchange of attribute values that contain such personal details between organisations is not allowed due to privacy concerns. The linking of records between databases without revealing the actual attribute values in these records is the research problem known as \u2018privacy-preserving record linkage\u2019(PPRL). While various approaches have been proposed to deal with privacy within the record linkage process, a viable solution that is well applicable to real-world conditions needs to address the major aspect of scalability of linking very large databases while preserving security and linkage quality. We propose a novel two-party protocol for PPRL that addresses scalability, security and quality/accuracy. The protocol is based on (1) the use of reference values that are available to both database owners, and allows them to individually calculate the similarities between their attribute values and the reference values; and (2) the binning of these calculated similarity values to allow their secure exchange between the two database owners. Experiments on a real-world database with nearly two million records yield linkage results that have a linear scalability to large databases and \u2026",

Association rule hiding is a new technique in data mining, which studies the problem of hiding sensitive association rules from within the data. Association Rule Hiding for Data Mining addresses the problem of\" hiding\" sensitive association rules, and introduces a number of heuristic solutions. Exact solutions of increased time complexity that have been proposed recently are presented, as well as a number of computationally efficient (parallel) approaches that alleviate time complexity problems, along with a thorough discussion regarding closely related problems (inverse frequent item set mining, data reconstruction approaches, etc.). Unsolved problems, future directions and specific examples are provided throughout this book to help the reader study, assimilate and appreciate the important aspects of this challenging problem. Association Rule Hiding for Data Mining is designed for researchers, professors and advanced-level students in computer science studying privacy preserving data mining, association rule mining, and data mining. This book is also suitable for practitioners working in this industry.",

The communication aspect is of high importance in educational research. Additionally, it is difficult to assess as it involves multiple relationships and different levels of interaction. Social network analysis (SNA) allows the visualization of this complexity and provides quantified measures for evaluation. Thus, initially, SNA techniques were applied to create one-mode, undirected networks and capture important metrics originating from students\u2019 interactions in the fora of the courses offered in the context of distance learning programs. Principal component analysis and clustering were used next to reveal latent students\u2019 traits and common patterns in their \u2026",

Locating the same real world entities within this information however is not trivial at all due to insufficient identifying information, misspellings, etc. The problem becomes even more complicated when privacy considerations arise. This introduction describes an informal approach to the privacy preserving record linkage problem. In this paper we provide a solution to this problem by examining the alternatives offered by phonetic codes, a range of algorithms which despite their age, are still used for record linkage purposes. The main contribution of our work, as our extensive experimental evaluation indicates, is that our methodology manages to offer privacy guarantees for performing Privacy \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The process of identifying which records in two or more databases correspond to the same entity is an important aspect of data quality activities such as data pre-processing and data integration. Known as record linkage, data matching or entity resolution, this process has attracted interest from researchers in fields such as databases and data warehousing, data mining, information systems, and machine learning. Record linkage has various challenges, including scalability to large databases, accurate matching and classification, and privacy and confidentiality. The latter challenge arises because commonly personal identifying data, such as names, addresses and dates of birth of individuals, are used in the linkage process. When databases are linked across organizations, the issue of how to protect the privacy and confidentiality of such sensitive information is crucial to successful application of record linkage.In \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this chapter, we elaborate on a novel framework, introduced in [25], that is suitable for decomposition and parallelization of the exact hiding algorithms that were covered in Chapters 14, 15 and 16. The framework operates in three phases to decompose CSPs that are produced by the exact hiding algorithms, into a set of smaller CSPs that can be solved in parallel. In the first phase, the original CSP is structurally decomposed into a set of independent CSPs, each of which is assigned to a different processor. In the second phase, for each independent CSP a decision is made on whether it should be further decomposed into a set of dependent CSPs, through a function that questions the gain of any further decomposition. In the third and last step, the solutions of the various CSPs, produced as part of the decomposition process, are appropriately combined to provide the solution of the original CSP (i.e. the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a methodology for hiding all sensitive frequent itemsets in a transaction database. Our methodology relies on a novel technique that enumerates the minimal transversals of a hypergraph in order to induce the ideal border between frequent and sensitive itemsets. The ideal border is then utilized to formulate an integer linear program (ILP) that answers whether a feasible sanitized database that attains the ideal border, exists. The solution of the program identifies the set of transactions that need to be modified (sanitized) so that the hiding can be achieved with the maximum accuracy. If no solution exists, we modify the ILP by relaxing the constraints needed to be satisfied so that the sanitized database preserves the privacy with guarantee but with minimum effect in data quality. Experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on a number of real datasets has shown that the produced sanitized \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a privacy model that offers trajectory privacy to the requesters of Location-Based Services (LBSs), by utilizing an underlying network of user movement. The privacy model has been implemented as a framework that (i) reconstructs the user movement from a series of independent location updates, (ii) identifies routes where user privacy is at risk, and (iii) anonymizes online user requests for LBSs to protect the requester for as long as the service withstands completion. In order to achieve (iii), we propose two anonymization techniques, the K\u2013present (weak) and the K\u2013frequent (strong) trajectory anonymity, and a second chance approach that takes over when anonymization fails to ensure that the privacy of the user is preserved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a trajectory privacy model that utilizes an underlying network of user movement to offer in an interactive \u2026",

A list of criteria is formed based on the findings of previous research and on the characteristics of comics which have been used effectively in teaching in past works. The results of the evaluation of a number of comic strip creator tools are presented and two cases of developing e-comics with the use of these tools are discussed. The main finding, is that despite some limitations, the tools can be successfully utilized to create alternative and more appealing representations of the teaching materials from teachers with no specialized knowledge on painting or comic designing.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, a vast amount of information is collected in real-time on a daily basis via users\u2019 handheld devices, web-based applications, and customer service interactions (among many others). The sheer volume of this data and the unprecedented rate at which it becomes available for processing, potentially combined with other attributes that are commonly met in traditional data sets, calls for novel online record linkage 1  techniques that can handle streams of data to discover records that refer to the same real-world entity.This paper introduces UniBlock, an online record linkage approach, supported by a novel data structure, that can adapt to any blocking algorithm to separate the most frequently accessed blocks from the rest, and maintain these blocks in main memory. In UniBlock, this separation is performed in a randomized way, where the probability of eviction of a block is inversely proportional to its frequency \u2026",

This methodology is based upon the unique characteristics of sequential covering classification algorithms. It modifies the tuples of sensitive rules of a dataset D in such a way that these are distributed to the\" more important\" non-sensitive rules.

            "Abstract": "The hiding of sensitive knowledge, mined from transactional databases, is one of the primary goals of privacy preserving data mining. The increased storage capabilities of modern databases and the necessity for hiding solutions of superior quality, paved the way for parallelization of the hiding process. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for decomposition and parallel solving of a category of hiding algorithms, known as exact. Exact algorithms hide the sensitive knowledge without any critical compromises, such as the blocking of non-sensitive patterns or the appearance of infrequent itemsets, among the frequent ones, in the sanitized outcome. The proposed framework substantially improves the size of the problems that the exact algorithms can efficiently handle, by significantly reducing their runtime. Furthermore, the generality of the framework makes it appropriate for any hiding algorithm that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning Analytics has truly revolutionized the way we gain knowledge about teaching and learning. A typical example concerns educational video design: the guidelines about educational videos based on previous pedagogical theories proposed that their duration should not exceed 30 minutes, while a massive data analysis of the dedication time on MOOCs videos came to eliminate this duration to 6 minutes (Guo et al., 2014). In the same year, Pennebaker and his team (Pennebaker et al., 2014) analyzed more than 50000 admission essays to concludeagainst all odds-that the use \u201csmall words\u201d(auxiliary verbs, pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, and negations) can be a strong indicator of future success.At the same time, a crucial factor for educational planning is the characteristics of the target groups. The new generation of students is highly familiar with the results of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their everyday life. They are used to putting up their data in order to have personalized feed in their social media platforms, in their Google search or in their music apps. Students to come, are going to expect the same flexibility from their learning platform as well (Dabbagh & Fake, 2017). Higher education institutions are starting to adopt prescriptive analytics methods as an advanced step in data employment. Performance Key Indicators (PKIs) are used to evaluate and predict students\u2019 performance in order to act accordingly. In the Global Guidelines concerning Ethics in Learning Analytics (Slade & Tait, 2019), produced recently by the International Council of Distance Learning (ICDE), one of the core-issues presented is \u201cthe Instructional responsibility \u2026",

All the above summarize the scope of the newly established Big Data Analytics and Anonymization Laboratory (BAT Lab) in the Hellenic Open University.

The data were collected using the semi-structured interview and the results showed that teleconferencing could be a strong complementary tool to support flexible learning as well as distance education, by enhancing the interaction among learners. All the interviewees consider teleconference as a\" helpful assistant\" in the educational process and suggested that the educators should be well prepared before the tele-lecture, as well as prepare and guide the learners in order to conduct a smooth teleconferencing session. From the interviews, several advantages and disadvantages of the teleconference\u2019s use as an educational tool emerged. The main advantages consist of the independence of space and time while conducting learning sessions, the easy access to and sharing of educational content, the interaction between educator and learners as well as among the learners and the reduced transportations along with time saving. On the other hand, some important disadvantages refer to the participants being unfamiliar with technology, lack of technological support, limited network resources causing disconnections and adding stress to participants, the uncertainty of the participants regarding the effectiveness of teleconference in education and the lack of face-to-face communication.",

            "Abstract": "Record (or entity) matching or linkage is the process of identifying records in one or more data sources, that refer to the same real world entity or object. In record linkage, the ultimate goal of a decision model is to provide the decision maker with a tool for making decisions upon the actual matching status of a pair of records (ie, documents, events, persons, cases, etc.). Existing models of record linkage rely on decision rules that minimize the probability of subjecting a case to clerical review, conditional on the probabilities of erroneous matches and erroneous non-matches. In practice though,(a) the value of an erroneous match is, in many applications, quite different from the value of an erroneous non-match, and (b) the cost and the probability of a misclassification, which is associated with the clerical review, is ignored in tills way.

As an effect, in most cases (depending on the problem instance at hand), the sensitive itemsets are expected to be positioned just below the revised borderline in the computed sanitized database . However, the selection of the minimum support threshold based on which the hiding is performed can lead to radically different solutions, some of which are bound to be superior to others in terms of offered privacy. In this chapter, we present a layered approach that was originally proposed in [27], which enables the owner of the data to quantify the privacy that is offered on a given database by the employed exact hiding algorithm.

A problem instance is defined as the set of (i) the original dataset , (ii) the minimum frequency threshold mfreq that is considered for its mining, and (iii) the set of sensitive itemsets S that have to be protected. Since the inline algorithm allows only supported items in  to become unsupported in , there exist problem instances that although they allow for an exact hiding solution, the inline approach is incapable of finding it.

This problem becomes significantly more challenging when the integration involves a huge amount of records and needs to be conducted in a real-time fashion to address the requirements of critical applications. In this paper, we propose two novel schemes for online record linkage, which achieve very fast response times and high levels of recall and precision. Our proposed schemes embed the records into a Bloom filter space and employ the Hamming Locality-Sensitive Hashing technique for blocking. Each Bloom filter is hashed to a number of hash tables in order to amplify the probability of formulating similar Bloom filter pairs.

This line of research can be primarily attributed to the growing concern of individuals, organizations and the government regarding the violation of privacy in the mining of their data by the existing data mining technology. As a result, a whole new body of research was introduced to allow for the mining of data, while at the same time prohibiting the leakage of any private and sensitive information. In this chapter, the authors introduce the readers to the field of privacy preserving data mining; they discuss the reasons that led to its inception, the most prominent research directions, as well as some important methodologies per direction.

By taking this into consideration, we study the discovery of association rules in binary data sets and we propose algorithms for selectively hiding sensitive association rules. Association rule hiding is a well researched area in privacy preserving data mining and many algorithms have been proposed to address it. The algorithms that we introduce use a distortion-based technique for hiding the sensitive rules.

Thus, privacy preserving record linkage has emerged with the goal of identifying matching records across multiple data sources while preserving the privacy of the individuals they describe. The task is very resource demanding, considering the abundance of available data, which, in addition, are often dirty. Blocking techniques are deployed prior to matching to prune out unlikely to match candidate records so as to reduce processing time. However, when scaling to large datasets, such methods often result in quality loss. To this end, we propose Multi-Sampling Transitive Closure for Encrypted Fields (MS-TCEF), a novel privacy preserving blocking technique based on the use of reference sets.

Academic institutions which offer open and distance learning programs, such as the Hellenic Open University, can benefit from big data relating to its students\u2019 information and communication systems and the use of modern techniques and tools of big data analytics provided that the student\u2019s right to privacy is not compromised. The balance between data mining and maintaining privacy can be reached through anonymisation methods but on the other hand this approach raises technical problems such as the loss of a certain amount of information found in the original data. Considering the learning process as a framework of interacting roles and factors, the discovery of patterns in that system can be really useful and beneficial firstly for the learners and furthermore, the ability to publish and share these results would be very helpful for the whole academic institution.",

These errors result in inconsistent, incomplete, or erroneous data elements. For example, a small variation in the representation of a data object, produces a unique instantiation of the object being represented. In order to improve the accuracy of the data stored in a database system, we need to compare them either with real-world counterparts or with other data stored in the same or a different system. In this paper, we address the problem of matching records which refer to the same entity by computing their similarity. Exact record matching has limited applicability in this context since even simple errors like character transpositions cannot be captured in the record-linking process.

            "Abstract": "Digital stories comprise a technological tool which can engage learners in collaborative learning as well as lead them to experientially acquire knowledge through a constructive process. The aim of the current action research, for which a cooperative network between academics and teachers was created, is to show how digital storytelling can emerge as an inclusive education tool through investigating the changes brought about by its implementation on the academic and social context of a school unit. The research was conducted in a Greek primary school and lasted seven months, involving two fifth grade classes and an integration class. It followed the three stages of a multi-thematic digital story project (preparation, implementation, and evaluation) and learners were called to research and process information, at their own pace, from diverse cognitive domains (art, science, coding). The research tools employed were participatory observation, diary research, and semi-structured interviews. The research positively influenced the reconstruction of the school unit since teachers reconsidered some of their educational techniques as non-inclusive, utilized technology as an instrument of constructive and experiential learning based on the diversity of each student, and reinforced learners\u2019 critical thinking and imagination while cultivating a climate of empathy and self-confidence among students.

First of all, the emergence of sophisticated exact hiding approaches of high complexity, especially for very large databases, causes the consideration of efficient parallel approaches to be employed for improving the runtime of these algorithms. Parallel approaches allow for decomposition of the constraints satisfaction problem into numerous components that can be solved independently. The overall solution is then attained as a function of the objectives of the individual solutions. A framework for decomposition and parallelization of exact hiding approaches has been recently proposed in [25] and is covered in Chapter 17 of the book. Although this framework improves the runtime of solving the constraints satisfaction problem that is produced by the exact hiding algorithms, we are confident the \u2026",

Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns often these organizations are not willing or allowed to reveal their sensitive and personal data to other database owners, and to any external party. This has led to the emerging research discipline of privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL). We propose a novel blocking approach for multi-party PPRL to efficiently and effectively prune the record sets that are unlikely to match. Our approach allows each database owner to perform blocking independently except for the initial agreement of parameter settings and a final central hashing-based clustering. We provide an analysis of our technique in terms of complexity, quality, and privacy, and conduct an empirical study with large datasets. The results show that our approach is scalable with the size of the datasets \u2026",

The induced patterns by the constraint-based mining algorithm are, in this way, utilized to build a minimal linear program whose solution dictates the construction of a database extension that delivers the sought-for hiding. This extension should be appended to the original database and released as a whole for mining, with that resulting extended database hiding the sensitive knowledge that we want to protect.

By taking this into consideration, we study the procedure of hiding sensitive association rules in binary data sets by blocking some data values and we present an algorithm for solving this problem. We also provide a fuzzification of the support and the confidence of an association rule in order to accommodate for the existence of blocked/unknown values. In addition, we quantitatively compare the proposed algorithm with other already published algorithms by running experiments on binary data sets, and we also qualitatively compare the efficiency of \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Data sharing among organizations has become an increasingly common procedure in several areas like advertising, marketing, e-commerce and banking, but any organization will probably attempt to keep some patterns as hidden as possible when it shares its datasets with others. This paper focuses on preserving the privacy of sensitive patterns when inducing decision trees. We adopt a record augmentation approach for hiding sensitive classification rules in binary datasets. Such a hiding methodology is preferred over other heuristic solutions like output perturbation or crypto-graphic techniques-which restrict the usability of the data-since the raw data itself is readily available for public use. We propose a look-ahead approach using linear Diophantine equations in order to add the appropriate number of instances while maintaining the initial entropy of the nodes. This technique can be used to hide one or more \u2026",

However, this deterministic process, including all its variants, might incur considerable overhead given massive data sets. In contrast, our method utilizes two Map/Reduce jobs where the first job formulates the record pairs while the second job distributes these pairs to the reduce tasks, which perform the distance computations, using repetitive allocation rounds. In each such round, we utilize all the available reduce tasks on a random basis by generating permutations of their indexes.

            "Abstract": "Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) addresses the problem of identifying matching records from different databases that correspond to the same real-world entities using quasi-identifying attributes (in the absence of unique entity identifiers), while preserving privacy of these entities. Privacy is being preserved by not revealing any information that could be used to infer the actual values about the records that are not reconciled to the same entity (non-matches), and any confidential or sensitive information (that is not agreed upon by the data custodians) about the records that were reconciled to the same entity (matches) during or after the linkage process. The PPRL process often involves three main challenges, which are scalability to large databases, high linkage quality in the presence of data quality errors, and sufficient privacy guarantees. While many solutions have been developed for the PPRL problem over the past two decades, an evaluation and comparison framework of PPRL solutions with standard numerical measures defined for all three properties (scalability, linkage quality, and privacy) of PPRL has so far not been presented in the literature. We propose a general framework with normalized measures to practically evaluate and compare PPRL solutions in the face of linkage attack methods that are based on an external global dataset. We conducted experiments of several existing PPRL solutions on real-world databases using our proposed evaluation framework, and the results show that our framework provides an extensive and comparative evaluation of PPRL solutions in terms of the three properties.",

Every move, click, and swipe of a card creates a virtual image of our lives in the form of a personal mosaic. Through sophisticated methods applied on these data, companies are now able to predict whether their products will appeal to people and target their advertising and market with maximum profit. In the competitive and globalized environment of education, institutions have to attract, assess and guide their students. In Greece, the Hellenic Open University (HOU) offers its courses in an open and distance learning mode. In contrast to a traditional university where most of the interaction and teaching is taking place on a face-to-face basis, at HOU the learning process is mainly facilitated via multimodal technological pathways and systems. It is important to homogenize and integrate the data collected from these systems in order to utilize it by gaining knowledge and building on it. To accomplish this, we use a learning analytics methodology to analyze the data and automatically create a detailed and holistic image of student performance, tutor effectiveness, and administration efficiency. This is then visualized through learning dashboards which convey important information so that each party can take necessary action and help the institution to improve its standing in the competitive educational environment. We aim to use the information within the systems where it is derived, since this makes the process more user friendly and accessible to all those involved.",

Private blocking techniques have been used in PPRL to address this challenge by reducing the number of record pair comparisons that need to be conducted. Many of these private blocking techniques require a trusted third party to perform the blocking. One main threat with three-party solutions is the collusion between parties to identify the private data of another party.",

Such information can play a vital role in deciding whether two records, coming from disparate data sources, correspond to the same real-world entity.

To reduce computational costs, in this paper, we propose the first Spark-based approach for distributed, on-demand, spatio-temporal linkage.

            "Abstract": "Given several databases containing personspecific data held by different organizations, privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) aims to identify and link records that correspond to the same entity/individual across different databases based on the matching of personal identifying attributes, such as name and address, without revealing the actual values in these attributes due to privacy concerns. The output is a set of matching clusters containing records of the same entity.",

            "Abstract": "Record (or entity) matching or linkage is the process of identifying records in one or more data sources, that refer to the same real world entity or object. In record linkage, the ultimate goal of a decision model is to provide the decision maker with a tool for making decisions upon the actual matching status of a pair of records (ie, documents, events, persons, cases, etc.). Existing models of record linkage rely on decision rules that minimize the probability of subjecting a case to clerical review, conditional on the probabilities of erroneous matches and erroneous non-matches. In practice though,(a) the value of an erroneous match is, in many applications, quite different from the value of an erroneous non-match, and (b) the cost and the probability of a misclassification, which is associated with the clerical review, is ignored in this way. In this paper, we present a decision model which is optimal, based on the cost of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Data cleaning is a vital process that ensures the quality of data stored in real-world databases. Data cleaning problems are frequently encountered in many research areas, such as knowledge discovery in databases, data warehousing, system integration and e-services. The process of identifying the record pairs that represent the same entity (duplicate records), commonly known as record linkage, is one of the essential elements of data cleaning. In this paper, we address the record linkage problem by adopting a machine learning approach. Three models are proposed and are analyzed empirically. Since no existing model, including those proposed in this paper, has been proved to be superior, we have developed an interactive record linkage toolbox named TAILOR (backwards acronym for \"RecOrd LInkAge Toolbox\"). Users of TAILOR can build their own record linkage models by tuning system parameters and \u2026",

The exact part uses the original database to formulate a Constraints Satisfaction Problem (CSP)1 in the universe of the sensitive itemsets, with the objective of identifying the minimum number of transactions that have to be sanitized for the proper hiding of the sensitive knowledge. The optimization process of solving the CSP is driven by a criterion function that is inspired from the measure of accuracy [42, 60], essentially penalizing the hiding algorithm based on the number of transactions (instead of items) that are sanitized from the original database to accommodate the hiding of the sensitive itemsets. The constraints imposed in the integer programming formulation aim to capture the transactions of the database that need to be \u2026",

By focusing on the knowledge hiding thread, we present a taxonomy and a survey of recent approaches that have been applied to the association rule hiding problem. Association rule hiding refers to the process of modifying the original database in such a way that certain sensitive association rules disappear without seriously affecting the data and the non-sensitive rules. We also provide a thorough comparison of the presented approaches, and we touch upon hiding approaches used for other data mining tasks. A detailed presentation of metrics used to evaluate the performance of those approaches is also given. Finally, we conclude our study by enumerating interesting future directions in this research body.",

We apply a heuristic approach to hide any arbitrary rule from the derivation of a binary decision tree. The proposed hiding method is preferred over other heuristic solutions such as output disturbance or encryption methods that limit data usability, as the raw data itself can then more easily be offered for access by any third parties.",

The toolkit is based on a simulator, designed to be highly configurable, modular and extensible, allowing the user to test different configurations by combining a number of privacy preserving blocking and matching methods with corresponding distance and similarity measures on her own or sample data. We showcase the usability of our toolkit by presenting experimental results measuring both quality and performance of state-of-the-art PPRL methods.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a reconstruction\u2014based approach to classification rule hiding in categorical datasets. The proposed methodology modifies transactions supporting both sensitive and nonsensitive classification rules in the original dataset and then uses the supporting transactions of the nonsensitive rules to produce its sanitized counterpart. To further investigate some interesting properties of this methodology, we explore three variations of the main technique which differ in the way they select and sanitize transactions supporting sensitive rules. Finally, through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms towards effectively shielding the sensitive knowledge.",

            "Abstract": "However, even though many solutions have been proposed towards addressing this problem, a new side effect rises regarding the privacy of the data which usually has to be protected during linkage. Sensitive information such as names, addresses, and illnesses, especially in cases of medical data, should not be revealed without further evidence to any participant of the merging procedure. This raises the need of creating new techniques for linking data while, at the same time, the privacy of the subjects described by these data is preserved. This need led to the evolvement of a new research area called privacy preserving record linkage. This chapter will attempt to present the state of the art of the methods proposed to address the privacy preserving record linkage problem and provide a taxonomy of these techniques based on their core characteristics.",

However, (sensitive) knowledge may appear in various forms directly related to the applied data mining algorithm that achieved to expose it. Consequently, a set of hiding approaches have been proposed over the years to allow for the safeguarding of sensitive knowledge exposed by data mining tasks such as clustering, classification and sequence mining. In this chapter, we briefly discuss some state-of-the-art approaches for the hiding of sensitive knowledge that is depicted in any of the aforementioned formats.",

Although collecting, using, and sharing educational data do offer substantial potential, the privacy-sensitivity of the data raises legitimate privacy concerns. The sharing of data among education organizations has become an increasingly common procedure. However, any organization will most likely try to keep some patterns hidden if it must share its datasets with others. This chapter focuses on preserving the privacy of sensitive patterns when inducing decision trees and demonstrates the application of a heuristic to an educational data set.

The analysis of this, so-called trajectory data, is beneficial both for the individuals (e.g., through location-based services) and for the community as a whole (e.g., decision support for urban planning or traffic control). However, because of the very nature of this data, strict safeguards must be enforced to ensure the privacy of the individuals, whose movement is recorded.In this paper, we present a privacy-aware trajectory tracking query engine that offers strict guarantees about what can be observed by untrusted third parties. Through the query engine, subscribed users can gain restricted access to an in-house trajectory data warehouse, to perform certain analysis tasks.

            "Abstract": "The current trend in the application space towards systems of loosely coupled and dynamically bound components that enables just-in-time integration jeopardizes the security of information that is shared between the broker, the requester, and the provider at runtime. In particular, new advances in data mining and knowledge discovery that allow for the extraction of hidden knowledge in an enormous amount of data, impose new threats on the seamless integration of information. We consider the problem of building privacy preserving algorithms for one category of data mining techniques, association rule mining. We introduce new metrics in order to demonstrate how security issues can be taken into consideration in the general framework of association rule mining, and we show that the complexity of the new heuristics is similar to that of the original algorithms.",

In particular, the trajectory of a mobile user on the plane is no longer a polyline in a two-dimensional space, instead it is a two-dimensional surface: we know that the trajectory of the mobile user is within this surface, but we do not know exactly where. We transform the surface\u2019s boundary poly-lines to dual points and we focus on the information distortion introduced by this space translation. We develop a set of efficient spatio-temporal access methods and we experimentally measure the impact of information distortion by comparing the performance results of the same spatio-temporal range queries executed on the original database and on the anonymized one.",

            "Abstract": " In an error-free system with perfectly clean data, the construction of a global view of the data consists of linking - in relational terms, joining - two or more tables on their key fields. Unfortunately, most of the time, these data are neither carefully controlled for quality nor necessarily defined commonly across different data sources. As a result, the creation of such a global data view resorts to approximate joins. In this paper, an optimal solution is proposed for the matching or the linking of database record pairs in the presence of inconsistencies, errors or missing values in the data. Existing models for record matching rely on decision rules that minimize the probability of error, that is the probability that a sample (a measurement vector) is assigned to the wrong class. In practice though, minimizing the probability of error is not the best criterion to design a decision rule because the misclassifications of different \u2026",

However, any organization will most likely try to keep some patterns hidden once it shares its datasets with others. This article focuses on preserving the privacy of sensitive patterns when inducing decision trees. We propose a heuristic approach that can be used to hide a certain rule which can be inferred from the derivation of a binary decision tree. This hiding method is preferred over other heuristic solutions like output perturbation or cryptographic techniques\u2014which limit the usability of the data\u2014since the raw data itself is readily available for public use. This method can be used to hide decision tree rules with a minimum impact on all other rules derived. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel, exact border-based approach that provides an optimal solution for the hiding of sensitive frequent itemsets by (i) minimally extending the original database by a synthetically generated database part - the database extension, (ii) formulating the creation of the database extension as a constraint satisfaction problem that is solved by using binary integer programming, and (Hi) providing an approximate solution close to the optimal one when an ideal solution does not exist. Extending the original database for sensitive itemset hiding is proved to provide optimal solutions to an extended set of hiding problems compared to previous approaches and to provide solutions of higher quality.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a framework which relies on the Map/Reduce paradigm    in order to distribute computations among underutilized commodity hardware    resources uniformly, without imposing an extra overhead on the existing    infrastructure. The volume of the distance computations, required for records    comparison, is largely reduced by utilizing the so-called Locality-Sensitive    Hashing technique, which is optimally tuned in order to avoid highly    redundant computations. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of    our distributed framework in finding the matched record pairs in voluminous    data sets.",

            "Abstract": "Privacy-preserving set intersection (PPSI) of very large data sets is increasingly being required in many real application areas including health-care, national security, and law enforcement. Various techniques have been developed to address this problem, where the majority of them rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques. Moreover, conventional data structures cannot be used efficiently for providing count estimates of the elements of the intersection of very large data sets. We consider the problem of efficient PPSI by integrating sets from multiple (three or more) sources in order to create a global synopsis which is the result of the intersection of efficient data structures, known as Count-Min sketches. This global synopsis furthermore provides count estimates of the intersected elements. We propose two protocols for the creation of this global synopsis which are based on homomorphic \u2026",

It was designed and created an app that students can download and use on their phones to answer Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) given by the teacher during class. Students can answer these questions by using their mobile phones, in real time, and the teacher can immediately get the results and see a graph distribution of their answers. This is a step towards encouraging the Active Learning Model and increasing student participation during class while also providing the teacher immediate feedback. A pilot testing has been conducted and results are discussed. Also, future actions are described.",

In this article, we introduce a novel framework for privacy-preserving large-scale linkage of electronic health records. As part of this framework, we utilize our proposed system, called LSHDB, which is a parallel and distributed data engine for performing Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) tasks, while offering formal guarantees of completeness of the results. We also demonstrate that the MapReduce extension of our framework, offers a robust and distributed solution for performing on-demand, large-scale privacy-preserving record linkage tasks in the healthcare domain.",

            "Abstract": "It has been recognized that sharing data between organizations can be of great benefit, since it can help discover novel and valuable information that is not available in individual databases. However, as organizations are under pressure to better utilize their large databases through sharing, integration, and analysis, protecting the privacy of personal information in such databases is an increasingly difficult task. Record linkage is the task of identifying and matching records that correspond to the same real\u2010world entity in several databases. This task implies a crucial infrastructure component in many modern information systems. Privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, commonly prevent the matching of databases that contain personal information across different organizations. In the past decade, efforts in the research area of privacy\u2010preserving record linkage (PPRL) have aimed to develop techniques that \u2026",

We adopt a record augmentation approach for hiding sensitive classification rules in binary datasets. Such a hiding methodology is preferred over other heuristic solutions like output perturbation or cryptographic techniques-which restrict the usability of the data-since the raw data itself is readily available for public use. We show some key lemmas which are related to the hiding process and we also demonstrate the methodology with an example and an indicative experiment using a prototype hiding tool.",

As a consequence, privacy preserving approaches have been proposed to protect the location information which is communicated during a request for an LBS. Most existing approaches are centralized as they rely on a trusted server to protect the real location of the user. Although the centralized approaches are commonplace, so far no attempt has been made to integrate them in a unified framework. Such an integration would provide the means for easily implementing and testing new techniques by offering ready-made vanilla system components and allow for both the experimental and analytical evaluation of the implemented techniques.In this paper we propose PLOT, an open-ended toolbox that allows the implementation and the evaluation of \u2026",

While such an effort sounds appealing for both academic and business applications, it is complicated and computationally intensive. In this paper we aspire to provide a solution to this problem by presenting a highly secure mutidimensional Privacy Preserving Blocking approach which is totally distributed and runs independently on each data holder, making it invulnerable to third party attacks. It is based on the idea of using publicly available corpora of data known as reference sets for creating k-anonymous clusters. We analytically prove that our method is secure and provide experimental results which evaluate the increased performance of our method in terms of matching accuracy and execution time.",

            "Abstract": "This paper introduces a privacy model for location based services that utilizes collected movement data to identify parts of the user trajectories, where user privacy is at an elevated risk. To protect the privacy of the user, the proposed methodology transforms the original requests into anonymous counterparts by offering trajectory K\u2013anonymity. As a proof of concept, we build a working prototype that implements our solution approach and is used for experimentation and evaluation purposes. Our implementation relies on a spatial DBMS that carries out part of the necessary analysis. Through experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to preserve the K\u2013anonymity of the users for as long as the requested services are in progress.",

Each short story presents a situation that children face while surfing the Internet. Through the emotions of the virtual characters and the existence of specific visual clues the tool seeks to make students to deliberate on the online activities and alter their attitudes. The design goals of the application and specific visual stories are first presented in the paper and then the paper is evaluated with the participation of teachers and students who provided us with positive feedback and some ideas for future improvements. The main findings of our research are discussed and potential extensions are presented.",

            "Abstract": "Record matching or linking is one of the phases of the data quality improvement process, in which, records from different sources, are cleansed and integrated in a centralized data store to be used for various purposes. Both, earlier and recent studies in data quality and record linkage focus on various statistical models, which make strong assumptions on the probabilities of attribute errors. In this study, we evaluate different models for record linkage, which are built based on data only. We use a program that generates data with known error distributions and we train classification models, which we use to estimate the accuracy and the completeness of the record linking process. The results indicate that the automated learning techniques are adequate for this process and that both their accuracy and their completeness are comparable to the accuracy and the completeness of other, mostly manual, processes.",

For an increasing number of companies that rely on information as one of their most important assets, enforcing high data quality levels represents a strategic investment aimed at preserving the value of those assets. For a public administration or a government, good data quality translates into good service and good relationships with the citizens. Achieving high quality standards, however, is a major task because of the variety of ways that errors might be introduced in a system, and the difficulty of correcting them in a systematic way. Problems with data quality tend to fall into two categories. The first category is related to inconsistency among systems such as format, syntax and semantic inconsistencies. The second category is related to inconsistency with reality as it is exemplified by missing \u2026",

Much of today\u2019s data collected by businesses and governments are about people, and integrating such data across organizations can raise privacy concerns. Various techniques that preserve privacy during data integration have been developed, but several challenges persist that need to be solved before such techniques become useful in practical applications. We elaborate on these challenges and discuss research directions.",

            "Abstract": "In this chapter, we review some popular support-based and confidence-based distortion algorithms that have been proposed in the association rule hiding literature. Distortion-based approaches operate by selecting specific items to include to (or exclude from) selected transactions of the original database in order to facilitate the hiding of the sensitive association rules. Two of the most commonly employed strategies for data distortion involve the swapping of values between transactions [10, 20], as well as the deletion of specific items from the database [54]. In the rest of this chapter, we present an overview of these approaches along with other methodologies that also fit in the same class.",

When privacy restrictions apply, the data sources may only have access to the merged records of the linkage process, comprising the problem of privacy preserving record linkage. As data are often dirty, and there are no common unique identifiers, the linkage process requires approximate matching and it renders to a very resource demanding task especially for large volumes of data. To speed up the linkage process, privacy preserving blocking and meta-blocking techniques are deployed. Such techniques derive groups of records that are more likely to match with each other. In this nectar paper, we summarize our contributions to privacy preserving blocking and meta-blocking.",

            "Abstract": "Today\u2019s technological advances have led to tremendous advances in collecting, storing and analyzing data that come from diverse sources of information and may be represented in a wide variety of different formats (texts, photos, videos and many more). The term which perfectly describes this milestone in the history of computing is called big data and the task of analyzing these enormous amounts of data is called big data analytics. Academic institutions which offer open and distance learning programs such as the Hellenic Open University can profit from big data and the use of big data analytics by integrating it in their organizational support systems thus reflecting on their overall performance and planning competitive and attractive educational programs as well as improving in the delivery of their services. In the individual level, the modern lifestyle with the numerous networked devices and applications implies that all activities we are engaged in leave behind an imprint or a digital footprint. Combining thoroughly this variety of information creates a unique social genome (Kum et. al., 2014) for each and every one of us and understanding how to interpret it will bring major breakthroughs in many areas of our society such as improvements in social services, health and education. On the flip side, there are certain disadvantages concerning privacy issues arising from the inappropriate and illegitimate use of data containing personal information and ethical concerns about the basic right of individuals to have control over the amount and the extent of information they are willing to share. The systematic solution to this controversy is the design \u2026",

The purpose of the workshop was to bring together researchers from different areas of data mining and machine learning, with an interest in privacy and security, to discuss recent results and open problems and to enable future collaborations. We received 21 submissions, each of which received at least 2, and on average 3.6, reviews. We wish to thank the reviewers for their excellent feedback to the authors, which directly contributed to the workshop\u2019s success. The committee decided to accept 11 papers for an engaging full-day program touching upon multiple aspects of the workshop\u2019s theme. One theme was data privacy, ie, how to perform computations on data without revealing the data itself or any sensitive \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Often, in the real world, entities have two or more representations in databases. Duplicate records do not share a common key and/or they contain errors that make duplicate matching a difficult task. Errors are introduced as the result of transcription errors, incomplete information, lack of standard formats, or any combination of these factors. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the literature on duplicate record detection. We cover similarity metrics that are commonly used to detect similar field entries, and we present an extensive set of duplicate detection algorithms that can detect approximately duplicate records in a database. We also cover multiple techniques for improving the efficiency and scalability of approximate duplicate detection algorithms. We conclude with coverage of existing tools and with a brief discussion of the big open problems in the area",

Traditional record linkage algorithms are unable to support such time-critical applications, as they perform the linkage offline and provide the result set only when the entire process has completed. To address this need, in this paper we propose the first summarization algorithms that operate in the blocking and matching steps of record linkage to speed up online linkage tasks. Our first method, called SkipBloom, efficiently summarizes the participating data sets, using their blocking keys, to allow for very fast comparisons among them. The second method, called BlockSketch, summarizes a block to achieve a constant number of comparisons for a submitted query record, during the matching phase. Our third method, SBlockSketch, operates on data \u2026",

Given large data collections of person-specific information, providers can mine data to learn patterns, models, and trends that can be used to provide personalized services. The potential benefits of data mining are substantial, but it is evident that the collection and analysis of sensitive personal data arouses concerns about citizens\u2019 privacy, confidentiality, and freedom.",

In this paper, we propose the first approach for spatio-temporal record linkage that leverages the power of LSH to provide accuracy guarantees. Through experimental evaluation, we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method and can scale well to large datasets.",

            "Abstract": "Location-Based Services (LBSs) have long been established in several regions of the world to allow mobile users, equipped with positioning devices, access a set of spatially aware services. In this chapter, we introduce a privacy framework for LBSs that utilizes collected movement data to identify parts of the user trajectories, where user privacy is at an elevated risk. To protect the privacy of the user, the proposed methodology transforms the original requests into anonymous counterparts by offering trajectory K-anonymity. As a proof of concept, we build a working prototype that implements our solution approach and is mainly used for experimentation and evaluation purposes. Our implementation relies on a spatial DBMS that carries out part of the necessary analysis. Finally, through a set of experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to preserve the K-anonymity of the users for as long as the requested services are in progress. \u00a9 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This study focuses on the need for student\u2019s voice to be heard and consid\u00ac ered during educa\u00ac tional planning. By doing this, the study intends to detect which students are marginalized, and use this method towards school improvement. The research was con\u00ac ducted in two kindergartens. In the first, twenty-two students and two teachers were interviewed (kindergarten teacher and headmistress), while in the second, we used the method of non-participant observa\u00ac tion with five children attending the integration class, as well as the teachers, during one month. Interviews were conducted in the second school, too, only with two teachers (qualified pedagogue and headmistress). During our study, margin\u00ac alized students have been identified due to the difficulties they face, and we have managed to strengthen children\u2019s confidence, and help create a more empathetic school environment. These have been implemented through a school pro\u00ac ject in which students narrate their personal stories using digital storytelling software. Our aim has also been to encourage the creation of stories for the pro-duction of which Scratch digital storytelling software was used.",

Data mining methodologies are widely applied to analyze data logs and predict trends for early and efficient interventions. Thus, the retention of students in the educational process can be achieved with positive effects on the reputation and finances of the institutions. This work divides the moodle data sets from six different sections of an annual postgraduate program at the Hellenic Open University in six periods for each section, due to the number of written assignments. Then it implements data mining techniques to analyze the activity, polarity and emotions of tutors and students in order to predict students\u2019 grades.

            "Abstract": "The hiding of sensitive knowledge in the form of frequent itemsets, has gained increasing attention over the past years. This paper highlights the process of border revision, which is essential for the identification of hiding solutions bearing no side-effects, and provides efficient algorithms for the computation of the revised positive and the revised negative borders. By utilizing border revision, we unify the theory behind two exact hiding algorithms that guarantee optimal solutions both in terms of database distortion and side-effects introduced by the hiding process. Following that, we propose a novel extension to one of the hiding algorithms that allows it to identify exact hiding solutions to a much wider range of problems (than its original counterpart). Through experimentation, we compare the exact hiding schemes against two state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and demonstrate their ability to consistently provide \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Complex problems, whether scientific or engineering, are most often solved today by utilizing public domain or commercial libraries or some form of problem solving environment. The task of \u201cselecting\u201d the best software for a targeted application or computation is often difficult and sometimes even intractable. We have proposed an approach for dealing with this issue by \u201cmining\u201d performance data of scientific software to generate knowledge that can be used to select software for a particular scientific problem, assuming some computational objectives. In this chapter we describe a framework together with its software implementation for mining performance data of scientific software and using the results to generate knowledge necessary to solve the software selection problem.",

The proposed solution also includes logging mechanisms that facilitate positioning research dataset development in open format. To present the capabilities of the solution, we deliver the concept of K-anonymity to protect mobile users that issue queries to location-based services. Experimental evaluation of the solution includes development of real-life logging dataset using smartphones by volunteers. Different flavours of anonymity algorithms are easy to be included and tested.

Our protocol assumes no trust on a third party and/or other peers, and it is specifically suited for low-min entropy data (i.e., data that can be exhaustively searched by an attacker), such as encrypted users locations. We demonstrate that our primitive is secure and efficient: Two public-key exponentiations are required, per each user, for each equality testing. We give implementation results, showing that our primitive is practical in a multiple users scenario. Finally, we describe how we could use our primitive as a building block for a proximity testing buddy-finder service for social networks.",

However, it is only recently that researchers were able to identify exact solutions for the hiding of knowledge, depicted in the form of sensitive frequent itemsets and their related association rules. Exact solutions allow for the hiding of vulnerable knowledge without any critical compromises, such as the hiding of nonsensitive patterns or the accidental uncovering of infrequent itemsets, amongst the frequent ones, in the sanitized outcome. In this paper, we highlight the process of border revision, which plays a significant role towards the identification of exact hiding solutions, and we provide efficient algorithms for the computation of the revised borders. Furthermore, we review two algorithms that identify exact hiding solutions, and we extend the functionality of one of them to effectively identify \u2026",

The software consists of various activities in order to contribute to the students and help them understand the specific concept. The results of the research showed that the representation implemented through the software, of the computer RAM memory as one-column array storing the variables, helped the students to overcome their misconceptions and deeply understand the concept of the programming variable. Also the design of the software and the activities motivated the students and gave them the chance to learn and understand deeper than those who were taught with the suggested way through the school book.",

Unlike data distortion schemes, blocking methodologies do not add any false information to the original database and thus provide a much safer alternative for critical real life applications, where the distinction between \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cunknown\u201d can be vital. Due to the introduction of unknowns, the support and the confidence of association rules that are mined from the sanitized database becomes fuzzified to an interval (rather than being an exact value) and can no longer be safely estimated. Blocking approaches, similarly to distortion approaches, can be partitioned into support-based and confidence \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Learning analytics, or educational data mining, is an emerging field that applies data mining methods and tools for the exploitation of data coming from educational environments. Learning management systems, like Moodle, offer large amounts of data concerning students' activity, performance, behavior, and interaction with their peers and their tutors. The analysis of these data can be elaborated to make decisions that will assist stakeholders (students, faculty, and administration) to elevate the learning process in higher education. In this work, the power of Excel is exploited to analyze data in Moodle, utilizing an e-learning course developed for enhancing the information computer technology skills of school teachers in primary and secondary education in Greece. Moodle log files are appropriately manipulated in order to trace daily and weekly activity of the learners concerning distribution of access to resources, forum participation, and quizzes and assignments submission. Learners' activity was visualized for every hour of the day and for every day of the week. The visualization of access to every activity or resource during the course is also obtained. In this fashion teachers can schedule online synchronous lectures or discussions more effectively in order to maximize the learners' participation. Results depict the interest of learners for each structural component, their dedication to the course, their participation in the fora, and how it affects the submission of quizzes and assignments.

            "Abstract": "In this work, we study the problem of privacy-preservation data publishing in moving objects databases. In particular, the trajectory of a mobile user in a plane is no longer a polyline in a two-dimensional space, instead it is a two-dimensional surface of fixed width , where  defines the semi-diameter of the minimum spatial circular extent that must replace the real location of the mobile user on the XY-plane, in the anonymized (kNN) request. The desired anonymity is not achieved and the entire system becomes vulnerable to attackers, since a malicious attacker can observe that during the time, many of the neighbors' ids change, except for a small number of users. Thus, we reinforce the privacy model by clustering the mobile users according to their motion patterns in (u, ) plane, where u and  define the velocity measure and the motion direction (angle) respectively. In this case, the anonymized (kNN) request looks up neighbors, who belong to the same cluster with the mobile requester in (u, ) space: Thus, we know that the trajectory of the k-anonymous mobile user is within this surface, but we do not know exactly where. We transform the surface's boundary poly-lines to dual points and we focus on the information distortion introduced by this space translation. We develop a set of efficient spatiotemporal access methods and we experimentally measure the impact of information distortion by comparing the performance results of the same spatiotemporal range queries executed on the original database and on the anonymized one.",

Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Exploratory Data Analysis techniques can be used to make sense out of these multidimensional and endlessly generated data in order to offer added value to the higher educational academic institutes and universities. In this paper, we present a learning analytics approach that has as its goal to improve both the learning experience of students and the instructional experience of tutors, as well as the institutional strategic view of the university. By exploring and analyzing all the collected data, we build models that explain and assess the effectiveness of the learning environment, so as to address the needs of the aforementioned members of these organizations. In this underlying framework, we also present and evaluate a case study that focuses on analyzing educational data for assessment purposes from a big data infrastructure, which is under development in the Hellenic Open University in Greece.",

The integration of ICTs is enhanced by the advent of mobile, wireless, and ubiquitous technologies. ICTs are increasingly embedded in common services, such as mobile and wireless communication, Internet browsing, credit card e-transactions, and electronic health records. As ICT-based services become ubiquitous, our everyday actions leave behind increasingly detailed digital traces in the information systems of ICT-based service providers. For example, consumers of mobile-phone technologies leave behind traces of geographic position to cellular provider records, Internet users leave behind traces of the Web pages and packet requests of their computers in the access logs of domain and network administrators, and credit card transactions reveal the locations and times where purchases were completed.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we describe the initiatives taking place within the Big Data Analytics and Anonymization Lab at the Hellenic Open University. The object of this lab is to conduct research in the field of large scale data management and analysis in conjunction with privacy protection of this data with the view to understand student behavior and interaction both with their peers but also with the teaching staff. The desired outcome is to be able to make decisions that will benefit not only the students by improving the learning process but will also enable the faculty, administration and the institution to take steps that will elevate the services it provides.In a few words, what we endeavor is to take advantage of sources of data within our student and teaching population which we believe are appropriate for the application of Learning Analytics techniques. We then apply these techniques in order to detect actionable and novel patterns, which will offer us a deeper understanding of the educational process and how it can be improved. This process requires specialist knowledge of the techniques and the tools involved, as well as being knowledgeable about the field in which the techniques will be applied and any special requirements that apply to this specific field.",

            "Abstract": "The rapid growth of transactional data brought, soon enough, into attention the need of its further exploitation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of securing sensitive knowledge from being exposed in patterns extracted during association rule mining. Instead of hiding the produced rules directly, we decide to hide the sensitive frequent itemsets that may lead to the production of these rules. As a first step, we introduce the notion of distance between two databases and a measure for quantifying it. By trying to minimize the distance between the original database and its sanitized version (that can safely be released), we propose a novel, exact algorithm for association rule hiding and evaluate it on real world datasets demonstrating its effectiveness towards solving the problem.",

            "Abstract": "In privacy-preserving record linkage, a number of data custodians encode their records and submit them to a trusted third-party who is responsible for identifying those records that refer to the same real-world entity. In this paper, we propose FEDERAL, a novel record linkage framework that implements methods for anonymizing both string and numerical data values, which are typically present in data records. These methods rely on a strong theoretical foundation for rigorously specifying the dimensionality of the anonymization space, into which the original values are embedded, to provide accuracy and privacy guarantees under various models of privacy attacks. A key component of the applied embedding process is the threshold that is required by the distance computations, which we prove can be formally specified to guarantee accurate results. We evaluate our framework using three real-world data sets with \u2026",

For interoperability reasons, the assessment items are encoded using the IMS QTI standard and the topics are represented in Topic Maps XML. Items are included in the Topic Map as occurrences in one or more subtopics. The items are retrieved using parameterized XQuery scripts and they are adaptively presented to the user based on their knowledge level. Furthermore, some visual clues are associated to the items in the test that participants should attempt. The evaluation experiments showed that the tool supports more effectively self-assessment and motivates users to be more actively engaged.",

            "Abstract": "Phonetic codes such as Soundex and Metaphone have been used in the past to address the Record Linkage Problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, no particular effort has been made within this context towards privacy assurance during the matching process. Phonetic codes have an interesting feature which can be cornerstone to providing privacy. They are mappings of strings which do not exhibit the one-to-one properly. In this paper, we present a novel protocol for achieving privacy preserving record linkage using phonetics, we provide proof of correctness for our approach and finally we illustrate experimental results concerning performance and matching accuracy. The proposed protocol can be equally well applied to codes different than the phonetic ones, which do not exhibit the one-to-one property, such as hash tables with comparable results.",

Through this lens, useful conclusions can be drawn from students\u2019 data that could help to improve the teaching and learning process. In this paper, a number of forum posts were analyzed and the role of tutors and students was scrutinized through the use of network visualization. It was found that certain students have a central positive role in the discussion forum although tutors have the main burden of answering and keeping the interaction alive. These students can act as the more knowledgeable other and support their peers. Further research in order to gain insight into students\u2019 interaction and promote collaboration, is proposed.",

            "Abstract": "Data sharing has become an increasingly common procedure among financial institutions, but any organisation will most probably attempt to conceal some critical rules before exchange their information with others. This paper concentrates on protecting sensitive rules when we assume that binary decision trees will be the models to be induced by the shared data. The suggested heuristic hiding technique is preferred over other heuristic solutions such as output disturbance or encryption methods that restrict data usability, as the raw data itself can then more easily be offered for access by any third parties. In this article, we present a paradigm of using the Local Distortion Hiding (LDH) algorithm in a real-life financial data set to hide a sensitive rule.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the frequent item set hiding problem, by formulating it as an integer linear program (ILP). The solution of the ILP points out the transactions that need to be sanitized in order to achieve the hiding of the sensitive frequent item sets, while the impact on other non-sensitive item sets is minimized. We present a novel heuristic approach to calculate the coefficients of the objective function of the ILP, while at the same time we minimize the side effects introduced by the hiding process. We also propose a sanitization algorithm that performs the hiding on the selected transactions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on real datasets and we compare the results of the newly proposed method with those of other state of the art approaches.",

            "Publication url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10543",
            "Abstract": "Advances in data collection and data storage technologies have given way to the establishment of transactional databases among companies and organizations, as they allow enormous amounts of data to be stored efficiently. Useful knowledge can be mined from these data, which can be used in several ways depending on the nature of the data. Quite often companies and organizations are willing to share data for the sake of mutual benefit. However, the sharing of such data comes with risks, as problems with privacy may arise. Sensitive data, along with sensitive knowledge inferred from this data, must be protected from unintentional exposure to unauthorized parties. One form of the inferred knowledge is frequent patterns mined in the form of frequent itemsets from transactional databases. The problem of protecting such patterns is known as the frequent itemset hiding problem. In this paper we present a toolbox, which provides several implementations of frequent itemset hiding algorithms. Firstly, we summarize the most important aspects of each algorithm. We then introduce the architecture of the toolbox and its novel features. Finally, we provide experimental results on real world datasets, demonstrating the efficiency of the toolbox and the convenience it offers in comparing different algorithms.",

Data is migrated to MongoDB, a NoSQL database management system, and analysed using the rmongodb package of R statistical environment. We focus in sentiment analysis to extract the emotional knowledge of students' fora. Polarity and emotion are identified in messages and are classified as positive, negative or neutral. Messages are categorized and visualized in six basic emotions, as a multiclass approach in understanding students' written opinion. By identifying sentiment behaviour from students' discussion fora, we are able to assess the effectiveness of the learning environment to improve students' learning experience, tutors' instructional experience and the university's institutional strategic view.",

            "Abstract": "Record linkage has received significant attention in recent years due to the plethora of data sources that have to be integrated to facilitate data analyses. In several cases, such an integration involves disparate data sources containing huge volumes of records and must be performed in near real-time in order to support critical applications. In this paper, we propose the first summarization algorithms for speeding up online record linkage tasks. Our first method, called SkipBloom, summarizes efficiently the participating data sets, using their blocking keys, to allow for very fast comparisons among them. The second method, called BlockSketch, summarizes a block to achieve a constant number of comparisons for a submitted query record, during the matching phase. Additionally, we extend BlockSketch to adapt its functionality to streaming data, where the objective is to use a constant amount of main memory to handle potentially unbounded data sets. Through extensive experimental evaluation, using three real-world data sets, we demonstrate the superiority of our methods against two state-of-the-art algorithms for online record linkage.",
