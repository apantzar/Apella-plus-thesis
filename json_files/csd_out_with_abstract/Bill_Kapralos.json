The method calculates the average distance to the nearest surfaces in the environment and an approximate measure of the fraction of sound energy that would be reflected from those surfaces. Both of these values are then used to drive the reverberation effects of an audio API. The method can potentially provide interactive response for the appropriate selections of geometry and hardware.

In order to overcome some of the limitations associated with the analysis of network logs, here we present an approach whereby sonification, that is the use of sound to convey non-sound information at the computer interface, is employed to map the data within a network log into meaningful sound and thus allow for a simple and intuitive sound-based network intrusion detection system.

Despite its importance in the real-world, diffraction effects are often overlooked by acoustical modeling methods leading to a degredation in immersion or presence. This paper describes an acoustical diffraction method based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle. The method is simple and efficient allowing it to be incorporated in interactive acoustical environments including virtual environments. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the method and its conformance to theoretical diffraction models.",

SGs are becoming ever more appealing for education and training, and several research coordination initiatives have been undertaken recently, such as the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www. galanoe. eu/)(GaLA) EU FP7 Network of Excellence (NoE)[4] and the Serious Games Network (http://www. seriousgamesnet. eu/)(Segan) EU Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) NoE. The main goal of these networks is to study SGs so that they can become an effective and reliable tool for education and corporate training. To this end, it is necessary to substantiate the growing interest and appeal of SGs within the scientific and education communities through the definition of proper principles and concrete tools, methodologies, and practices for design and deployment of SGs [5, 6].",

The PBL approach has been adopted for over four decades in such fields as medicine and engineering and studies have demonstrated that students working in a PBL context have improved their skill levels over students enrolled in traditional lecture\u2010based classes. In spite of these successes, PBL has not yet been often considered in computer science/IT\u2010related academic programs. This is due to a variety of factors, including lack of support from faculty, historical approaches precluding such innovation, and lack of motivation to innovate beyond the dominant and more traditionally known approaches.

Typically, they focus on one virtual scenario (e.g., training for a particular health care condition) and do not allow the scenario to be modified simply. This paper presents an overview of a Scenario Editor that allows for developing new or modifying existing virtual simulations and serious game scenarios using a graphical user interface. Our focus in scenario design is currently on mental health education, where interactions occur between an avatar representing the patient and the trainee taking on the health care professional\u2019s role. The Scenario Editor allows health care educators, who may have limited computer science/programming experience, to develop or modify customized virtual learning experiences intuitively.",

In all conditions an over-estimation of self-motion of measures that varied systematically with the simulated acceleration. Of particular interest was that audio cues combined with physical motion cues resulted in more accurate estimates of self-motion than did either audio or physical motion cues in isolation.",

Interprofessional education and training for critical care response teams (CCRTs) training is complex and expensive. A more cost-effective alternative is the use of interactive virtual environments or serious games that offer a feasible alternative to traditional methods as multiple team members may participate in the simulation simultaneously regardless of their physical location or time of day. Here we provide an overview of a serious game whose purpose is to augment learning of skills, knowledge, and attitudes requisite in interprofessional education for CCRTs.",

Through the use of a probabilistic Russian roulette strategy to determine the type of interaction between a sound and any objects/surfaces it may encounter, sonel mapping avoids excessively large running times in contrast to deterministic techniques. Sonel mapping approximates many of the subtle interaction effects required for realistic acoustical modeling yet due to its probabilistic nature, can be incorporated into interactive virtual environments where accuracy is often substituted for efficiency.

            "Publication url": "https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/49995",
            "Abstract": "Of the many cues that could be used to gauge selfmotion, auditory cues seem to be the least studied. Listeners could potentially use either a sweep of rising sound intensity to judge their self-motion towards an object or conversely use a sweep of falling sound intensity to judge their motion away from an object. Whether the sweep is rising or falling the listener must judge both the change in intensity across the sweep, and the temporal span of the sweep. Studies indicate that sweeping intensities are misperceived so that the sound intensity at the end of the sweep is judged differently than when the final sound intensity is presented alone. Although there is ongoing discussion as to whether the induced fading is greater for rising sound intensity as opposed to falling sound intensity, both phenomena affect the perception of self-motion. This paper presents a series of experiments that examined self-motion perception with auditory cues. Results confirm the finding of decruitment for a sweeping broadband sound source that decreases at various rates of acceleration. Furthermore, the phenomenon of decruitment was greatly diminished at higher accelerations indicating that this phenomenon is likely correlated to the lowest rate at which listeners can perceive a change in intensity.",

            "Abstract": "Eye fundus examination requires extensive practice to enable the adequate interpretation of the anatomy observed as a flat image seen through the ophthalmoscope, which is a handheld device that allows for the non-invasive examination of the back of the eye. Mastering eye examination with an ophthalmoscope is difficult due to the intricate volumetric anatomy of the eye when seen as a two-dimensional image when examined through the lens of an1 ophthalmoscope. The lack of eye examination skills in medical practitioners is a cause of concern in today\u2019s medical practise as misdiagnosis can result in improper or prompt treatment of life-threatening conditions such as glaucoma, high blood pressure, or diabetes amongst others. Past and current solutions to the problem of ophthalmoscope education have seen the use of pictures, illustrations, videos, cadavers, patients, and volunteers. More recently, simulation \u2026",

Although the use of such touchscreen computers is still not widespread, given the growing popularity of multitouch mobile devices (eg, iPods and iPads, smartphones, etc.), the move to multi-user touchscreens and a horizontal surface is a likely trajectory of the technology. However, before table-top touchscreen computing becomes widely accepted, there are many questions, particularly with respect to sound production and reception, and multi-modal interaction for these devices that need to be explored.In this paper we provide an overview of a large table-top touchscreen computer setup and describe a simple amplitude panning method for the output of sound amongst four loudspeakers. The paper begins with a background on sound interaction design and follows with a description of an experimental smart table hardware setup for shared use. Its second part is dedicated to an object recognition vision system for global registration of sound sources, tracking of users, and controlling of virtual sound effects. The paper concludes with a consideration of table-top computer oriented sound experiments and a discussion of developed specialized software and GUI components supporting sound experiment control and user feedback registration with portable TabletPC communication devices.",

Such an increment actually acts as a virtual wide-angle sound focuser of wide area acoustic fields. We demonstrate the above Augmented Reality Audio Network (ARAN) concept in terms of a live electroacoustic music concert. A subjective evaluation derived strong and secure indications that the proposed ARAN framework may represent a strong alternative potential of legacy ARA in the artistic and creative domain.",

Stereoscopic 3-D display technology provides the users with additional visual information (depth into and out of the screen plane). There have been relatively few studies that have investigated the impact that auditory stimuli have on our perception of visual fidelity in the presence of stereoscopic 3-D.

In medical simulation, patient interactions are practiced employing standardized patients (i.e., actors) and most recently artificial intelligence driven avatars. Typical avatar interactions found in virtual simulators rely on buttons, text boxes, and drop-down menus to enable the interactions. While a similar approach is also employed in virtual reality, virtual keyboard inputs and point and click tasks on graphical user interface items using a mouse can be challenging and lead to increased cognitive loads.

For example, which loudspeaker setups should be used to take into consideration the multi-user nature of tabletop computers, and which panning method(s) maximize the spatial localization abilities of the user(s)? Previous work suggests that a quadraphonic diamond-shaped loudspeaker configuration\u2014whereby a loudspeaker is placed at each of the four sides of the tabletop computer\u2014leads to more accurate localization results when \u2026",

However, virtual environments including virtual simulations and serious games, and the human-computer interface more generally, have focused on the visual and auditory senses. Simulating the other senses such as the sense of smell (olfaction) can be beneficial for supporting learning. In this paper we present a simple and cost-effective olfactory interface constructed using an Arduino Uno microcontroller board, a small fan, an off-the-shelf air freshener to deliver scents to a user of a serious game. A fuzzy logic system regulated the amount of scent delivered to the user based on their distance to the display. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a serious game intended to teach basic math (counting) skills to children. Learners (players \u2026",

Despite the rise of mobile health (mHealth) apps and their known effectiveness for improving health behaviors, few evidence-based apps exist to help engage children in learning about nutrition and healthy eating.Objective: This study aimed to describe the iterative development and user testing of Foodbot Factory, a novel nutrition education gamified app for children to use at home or in the classroom and to present data from user testing experiments conducted to evaluate the app.Methods: An interdisciplinary team of experts in nutrition, education (pedagogy), and game design led to the creation of Foodbot Factory. First, a literature review and an environmental scan of the app marketplace were conducted, and stakeholders were consulted to define the key objectives and content of Foodbot Factory. Dietitian and teacher stakeholders identified priority age groups and learning objectives. Using a quasi-experimental mixed method design guided by the Iterative Convergent Design for Mobile Health Usability Testing approach, five app user testing sessions were conducted among students (ages 9-12 years). During gameplay, engagement and usability were assessed via direct observations with a semistructured form. After gameplay, qualitative interviews and questionnaires were used to assess user satisfaction, engagement, usability, and knowledge gained.Results: The environmental scan data revealed that few evidence-based nutrition education apps existed for \u2026",

However, given the large number of game engines and frameworks dedicated to entertainment game development, deciding on which tool to employ may be difficult. A literature review that examined the frameworks and game engines used to develop serious games was recently conducted. Here, a list of the most commonly identified frameworks and game engines and a summary of their features is provided. The results presented provide insight to those seeking tools to develop serious games.",

With the use of digital technologies within design and art practices, the affordances for sound are frequently present, but often under-used and misunderstood by those with an education that privileges the visual mode at the expense of other modalities. Despite the importance of sound within multimedia applications and the fact that digital art, video games, film, branding, and product design today all require some understanding of the sonic realm, art and design students often complete their degrees without following a single class related to sound and its perception.

The ability to interpret heart sounds is key during the diagnosis and only achieved through extensive training. Currently, there is great concern among physicians regarding the loss of cardiac auscultation skills, and the effects on proper diagnoses that may lead to inadequate treatments. Current cardiac auscultation training employs equipment that completes the diagnose without the use of a stethoscope, diminishing the amount of practice trainees obtain with it. However, despite the decreased emphasis on stethoscope training, the stethoscope remains a cost-effective tool and relevant in several examination scenarios.

            "Abstract": "When used in educational settings, simulations utilizing virtual reality (VR) technologies can reduce training costs while providing a safe and effective learning environment. Tasks can be easily modified to maximize learning objectives of different levels of trainees (eg, novice, intermediate, expert), and can be repeated for the development of psychomotor skills. VR offers a multisensory experience, providing visual, auditory, and haptic sensations with varying levels of fidelity. While simulating visual and auditory stimuli is relatively easy and cost-effective, similar representations of haptic sensation still require further development. Evidence suggests that mixing high-and low-fidelity realistic sensations (eg, audition and haptic) can improve the overall perception of realism, however, whether this also leads to improved performance has not been examined. The current study examined whether audiohaptic stimuli presented in a virtual drilling task can lead to improved motor performance and subjective realism, compared to auditory stimuli alone. Right-handed participants (n= 16) completed 100 drilling trials of each stimulus type. Performance measures indicated that participants overshot the target during auditory trials, and undershot the target during audiohaptic trials. Undershooting is thought to be indicative of improved performance, optimizing both time and energy requirements. View Full-Text",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Patients (VPs) were a mandatory component of the surgical rotation at McGill University for medical students and focused specifically on the teaching of trauma. These cases, written by clinicians and clinical researchers with research experience in VPs, enabled students not only to acquire core knowledge in the identification and management of trauma, but also provided an opportunity to practise skills, such as clinical decision-making and communicating in emotionally challenging situations (eg, approaching a family member to discuss organ donation). Both faculty and learners appreciate the significant advantage of using VPs: it is a teaching modality which provides meaningful educational opportunities to learners, without risk of harm to patients (Cook et al. in Acad Med 85 (10): 1589\u20131602,[7]; Voelker in J Am Med Assoc 290 (13): 1700\u20131701,[26]). The authors were inspired by their experiences with these VP cases and began to consider how they might be able to contribute to this field. They became convinced that they could expand on the service offerings that were available at that time, by developing a platform for medical learners. This chapter focuses on this journey. The authors (AS, OM), with another colleague, a software developer, approached faculty at McGill whose expertise was in developing and researching VP cases. This collaboration has led to the creation of the VP software platform, Affinity Learning, and a content-based VP company, VPConnect. In this chapter, we will discuss our experience partnering, as medical students, with members of academia, research, clinicians and industry to create a VP platform \u2026",

In order for knowledge and skills to become fully understood, integrated, and accessible for future situations, millennial students require reinforcement, application, repetition, and often practice in a variety of settings and contexts. In contrast to traditional teaching and learning environments where the teacher controls the learning, video games present a learner-centered approach whereby students control their learning experience through interactivity. Video games provide students the opportunity to explore the interrelationships of complex behaviors, sign systems, and the formation of social groups. Video game technology has been adopted and applied to various contexts in which its primary purpose is not entertainment. These are referred to as serious games. Serious games support the development of analytical and spatial, strategic, recollection, and psychomotor as well as visual selective attention skills. They also provide students the opportunity to practice these skills in a safe learning environment. Further benefits of serious games include improved self-monitoring, problem recognition and solving, improved short-and long-term memory, increased social skills, and increased self-efficacy. Recently, major efforts have been made in the development of serious games related to health and healthcare education and training. In this panel we will \u2026",

In this paper we present an overview of existing uses of games outside the entertainment category, describe an audio-based game that we designed for testing loudspeaker placement, and one that we will build to test the spatialization abilities of an amplitude panning method intended to be applied to four loudspeakers for a smart table computer. We conclude by outlining some other potential areas where games could be used in HCI research.",

The video sensor is used to provide a view of the entire visual hemisphere thereby providing multiple dynamic views of a scene. Color models of both skin and non-skin were constructed with images obtained with the omni-directional video sensor. Using a stochastic weak estimator coupled with a linear classifier, the system is capable of distinguishing omni-directional images that contain human skin from those that do not. Results indicate that the system is able to accomplish this task in a simple and computationally efficient manner. The ability to obtain an image of the entire scene from a single viewpoint using the omni-directional video sensor and determine whether the image contains human skin (eg, one or more humans) in a simple and efficient manner is practical as a precursor for a number of applications including teleconferencing, remote learning, and video surveillance, the application of interest in this work.",

            "Abstract": "Touch plays a fundamental role in our daily interactions, allowing us to interact with and perceive objects and their spatial properties. Despite its importance in the real-world, touch is often ignored in virtual environments. However, accurately simulating the sense of touch is difficult, requiring the use of high-fidelity haptic devices that are cost-prohibitive. Lower fidelity consumer-level haptic devices are becoming more widespread, yet are generally limited in perceived fidelity and the range of motion (degrees of freedom) required to realistically simulate many tasks. Studies into sound and vision suggest that the presence or absence of sound can influence task performance. Here, we explore whether the presence or absence of contextually relevant sound cues influences the performance of a simple haptic drilling task. Although the results of this study do not show any statistically significant difference in task performance with general (task-irrelevant) sound, we discuss how this is a necessary step in understanding the role of sound on haptic perception.

The Foodbot Factory serious game mobile application was developed to support school children in learning about Canada\u2019s Food Guide; however, its impacts on nutrition knowledge have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine if Foodbot Factory effectively improves children\u2019s knowledge of Canada\u2019s Food Guide, compared to a control group (control app). This study was a single-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled pilot study conducted among children ages 8\u201310 years attending Ontario Tech University day camps. Compared to the control group (n= 34), children who used Foodbot Factory (n= 39) had significant increases in overall nutrition knowledge (10.3\u00b12.9 to 13.5\u00b13.8 versus 10.2\u00b13.1 to 10.4\u00b13.2, p< 0.001), and in Vegetables and Fruits (p< 0.001), Protein Foods (p< 0.001), and Whole Grain Foods (p= 0.040) sub-scores. No significant difference in knowledge was observed in the Drinks sub-score. Foodbot Factory has the potential to be an effective educational tool to support children in learning about nutrition.

A collection of newly commissioned chapters on interactivity in music and sound edited by preeminent scholars in the field, this book marks the beginning of a journey into understanding the ways in which we interact with sound, and offers a new set of analytical tools for the growing field of interactive audio. What does it mean to interact with sound? How does interactivity alter our experience as creators and listeners? What makes interactive audio different from non-interactive audio? Where does interacting with audio fit into our understanding of sound and music? What does the future hold for interactive media when it comes to our musical and sonic experiences? And how do we begin to approach interactive audio from a theoretical perspective? The Oxford Handbook of Interactive Audio answers these questions by exploring the full range of interactive audio in video games, performance, education, environmental design, toys, and artistic practice. Examining these questions from a range of approaches--technological, emotional, psychological, and physical--the book provides a thorough overview of the fascinating experience of interactive sound.",

Although the majority of virtual environments place the emphasis on visual cues, replicating the complex interactions of sound within an environment will benefit the level of immersion and hence the user\u2019s sense of presence. Three dimensional (spatial) sound systems allow a listener to perceive the position of sound sources, and the effect of the interaction of sound sources with the acoustic structure of the environment. This paper reviews the relevant biological and technical literature relevant to the generation of accurate acoustic displays for virtual environments, beginning with an introduction to the process of auditory perception in humans. This paper then critically examines common methods and techniques that have been used in the past as well as methods and techniques which are currently being used to generate spatial sound. In the process of doing so, the limitations, drawbacks, advantages and disadvantages associated with these techniques are also presented.",

Our investigations showed that North American medical students receive little or no exposure to RO. Adding to a crowded medical curriculum is difficult, so the Virtual Experience in Radiation Oncology (VERO) was developed to supplement learning with simulated clinical experiences in RO. Methods: The VERO site explores 17 RO areas, basic RO principles (eg physics), career choices, research opportunities (simulated observership in radiobiology), and roles of the Radiation Oncologist in multidisciplinary teams. University of Toronto experts worked with medical students to develop the site content. Five focus groups and new user sessions (n= 4 students; n= 5 residents) revealed enthusiasm for VERO and generated content, formatting, and learning objectives. Results: Simulated clinical cases involving medical students illustrate decision-making and treatment management (eg, breast, larynx, and prostate cancers). Formative feedback from new user \u201cthink aloud\u201d sessions with students (n= 5) and residents (n= 4) and ongoing feedback from medical student reviewers shaped the final website. Discussion: Educators teaching about RO, medical students and residents, and those developing resources simulating clinical situations will find this online tool useful and user friendly.

It also helps build effective team relationships which is essential for optimal health care delivery. Currently interprofessional education includes classroom teaching, clinical placements, and practice in simulated environments using both high and low fidelity simulated patients. These strategies are resource intensive and present significant challenges including the release of team members from clinical responsibilities. Interactive virtual simulation environments, such as serious games, offer a feasible alternative to traditional methods as multiple team members may participate in the simulation simultaneously regardless of their physical location or time of day.

            "Abstract": "Direct ophthalmoscopy (DO) is a medical procedure whereby a health professional, using a direct ophthalmoscope, examines the eye fundus. DO skills are in decline due to the use of interactive diagnostic equipment and insufficient practice with the direct ophthalmoscope. To address the loss of DO skills, physical and computer-based simulators have been developed to offer additional training. Among the computer-based simulations, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR, respectively) allow simulated immersive and interactive scenarios with eye fundus conditions that are difficult to replicate in the classroom. VR and AR require employing 3D user interfaces (3DUIs) to perform the virtual eye examination. Using a combination of a between-subjects and within-subjects paradigm with two groups of five participants, this paper builds upon a previous preliminary usability study that compared the use of the HTC Vive controller, the Valve Index controller, and the Microsoft HoloLens 1 hand gesticulation interaction methods when performing a virtual direct ophthalmoscopy eye examination. The work described in this paper extends our prior work by considering the interactions with the Oculus Quest controller and Oculus Quest hand-tracking system to perform a virtual direct ophthalmoscopy eye examination while allowing us to compare these methods without our prior interaction techniques. Ultimately, this helps us develop a greater understanding of usability effects for virtual DO examinations and virtual reality in general.

After a two-week retention period, all students came back and performed one more trial to test the amount of retention of the skill. Tensiometry was used to measure strengths of the knots before and after the retention period. The scores showed no significant difference between the groups (p> 0.308) or tests (p> 0.737).

The sounds we hear provide us with detailed information about our surroundings and can assist us in determining both the distance and direction to objects, at times, very accurately [139]. This ability is extremely beneficial for both humans and a variety of other species and in many situations, is crucial for survival. We can \u201chear\u201d a sound in the dark where we may not necessarily make use of vision (sight) and, in contrast to the limited visual field of view, the auditory system is omni-directional, allowing us to hear sounds reaching us from any position in three dimensional space. Given this omni-directional aspect, hearing serves to guide our visual senses, or to quote Cohen and Wenzel [27],\u201cthe function of the ears is to point the eyes\u201d. Hearing, or audition also serves to guide the more \u201cfinely tuned\u201d visual attention thereby easing the burden of the visual system [119].Although sound is a critical cue to perceiving our environment, it is often overlooked in immersive virtual environments, where, historically, emphasis has been placed on the visual senses [27, 22]. The audio cues present in many of the virtual environments are rather poor and do not necessarily reflect natural cues despite the fact that natural (spatial) sound cues can allow a user to orient themselves in a virtual environment. In addition, audio cues can also add a \u201cpleasing quality\u201d to the simulation, add a better sense of \u201cpresence\u201d or \u201cimmersion\u201d and compensate for poor visual cues (graphics)[3, 119]. Furthermore, the virtual environments which actually employ spatial audio cues typically, assume a far field \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The generation of spatial audio and audio processing in general using traditional software-based methods and techniques is computationally prohibitive thereby limiting the number of, and type of auditory effects that can be incorporated into applications. In contrast to consumer-grade audio cards, the graphics processing units (GPUs) of video cards have moved away from the traditional fixed-function 3D graphics pipeline towards a flexible general-purpose computational engine that can currently implement many parallel algorithms directly using the graphics hardware resulting in tremendous computational speed-ups. Various spatial audio applications are well suited for GPU-based processing providing developers of virtual environments and games with the possibility of incorporating real-time, spatial audio into their simulations. This paper presents an overview of the research efforts that have utilized the GPU for the implementation of spatial sound for virtual environments and games. Approaches to GPU-based spatial sound are summarized and their advantages and disadvantages are presented.",

However, simulation all of the senses in real-time with a high level of fidelity is still not feasible and recent work has shown that high fidelity reproduction of the real world doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to the greatest user experience and outcomes. In the real world, senses interact with one another and alter each other\u2019s processing and ultimately perception.

To support this, intrusion detection analysis has been carried out using visual, auditory or tactile sensory information in computer interfaces. However, little is known about how to best integrate the sensory channels for analyzing intrusion detection alarms. In the past, we proposed a set of ideas outlining the benefits of enhancing intrusion detection alarms with multimodal interfaces.

            "Abstract": "When illusory self-motion is induced in a stationary observer by optic flow, the perceived distance traveled is generally overestimated relative to the distance of a remembered target (Redlick, Harris, & Jenkin, 2001): subjects feel they have gone further than the simulated distance and indicate that they have arrived at a target's previously seen location too early. In this article we assess how the radial and laminar components of translational optic flow contribute to the perceived distance traveled. Subjects monocularly viewed a target presented in a virtual hallway wallpapered with stripes that periodically changed color to prevent tracking. The target was then extinguished and the visible area of the hallway shrunk to an oval region 40 (h)\u00d7 24 (v). Subjects either continued to look centrally or shifted their gaze eccentrically, thus varying the relative amounts of radial and laminar flow visible. They were then presented with visual motion compatible with moving down the hallway toward the target and pressed a button when they perceived that they had reached the target's remembered position. Data were modeled by the output of a leaky spatial integrator (Lappe, Jenkin, & Harris, 2007). The sensory gain varied systematically with viewing eccentricity while the leak constant was independent of viewing eccentricity. Results were modeled as the linear sum of separate mechanisms sensitive to radial and laminar optic flow. Results are compatible with independent channels for processing the radial and laminar flow components of optic flow that add linearly to produce large but predictable errors in perceived distance traveled.",

The e-REAL immersive setting is fully interactive with both 2D and 3D visualizations, avatars, electronically writable surfaces and more: people can take notes, cluster key-concepts or fill questionnaires directly on the projected surfaces. The second part of this chapter summarizes an experiential coursework focused on learning and improving teamwork and event management during simulated obstetrical cases. Effective team management during a crisis is a core element of expert practice: for this purpose, e-REAL reproduces a variety of different emergent situations, enabling learners to interact with multimedia scenarios and practice using a mnemonic called Name-Claim-Aim. Learners rapidly cycle between deliberate practice and direct feedback within a simulation scenario until mastery is achieved.

Eye examination competence requires extensive training to properly interpret the visualized 2D fundus images from the 3D eye anatomy. Moreover, eye disorders where veins and arteries are inflamed are very difficult to detect and typically only detectable by expert examiners. Furthermore, the structure of a traditional ophthalmoscope makes it difficult for an instructor and student to experience a shared experience when using the device, resulting in assessments based on descriptions of what is being observed through the examination device.",

The wide variety of available technologies has also increased the number of traits and features that can be collected and used to more accurately identify people. Systems that use biological, physiological, or behavioral trait to grant access to resources are called biometric systems. In this paper we present a biometric identification system based on the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The system extracts 24 temporal and amplitude features from an ECG signal and after processing, reduces the set of features to the nine most relevant features. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the system is accurate and robust and can achieve a 100% identification rate with the reduced set of features.",

Although a human operator at the remote classroom could be used to direct a video camera and hence provide feedback to the instructor as to the state of the class and to coordinate the instructor\u2019s attention to the class as questions are raised, more automated techniques are desirable. Here we describe a novel audiovisual sensor to support distance learning. This sensor provides the instructor with a panoramic view of the class and can automatically attend to students who signal their intent to interact with the instructor either by raising their hand or by asking a question vocally.

In contrast to consumer-grade audio cards, the graphics processing units (GPUs) of video cards have moved away from the traditional fixed-function 3D graphics pipeline towards a flexible general-purpose computational engine that can currently implement many parallel algorithms directly using the graphics hardware resulting in tremendous computational speed-ups. Various spatial audio applications are well suited for GPU-based processing providing developers of virtual environments and games with the possibility of incorporating real-time, spatial audio into their simulations. This paper presents an overview of the research efforts that have utilized the GPU for the implementation of spatial sound for virtual environments and games. Approaches to GPU-based spatial sound are summarized and their advantages and disadvantages are presented.",

Despite the benefits of spatial sound cues, they are often overlooked in videogames and virtual environments where typically, emphasis is placed on the visual cues. Fundamental to the generation of spatial sound is the one-dimensional convolution operation which is computationally expensive, not lending itself to such real-time, dynamic applications. Driven by the gaming industry and the great emphasis placed on the visual sense, consumer computer graphics hardware, and the graphics processing unit (GPU) in particular, has greatly advanced in recent years, even outperforming the computational capacity of CPUs. This has allowed for real-time, interactive realistic graphics-based applications on typical consumer-level PCs. Given the widespread use and availability of computer graphics hardware and the similarities that exist between the fields of spatial audio and image synthesis, here we describe the development of a GPU-based, one-dimensional convolution algorithm whose efficiency is superior to the conventional CPU-based convolution method. The primary purpose of the developed GPU-based convolution method is the computationally efficient generation of real-time spatial audio for dynamic and interactive videogames and virtual environments.",

In this article, we present two interactive and engaging posture-tracking user interfaces intended to promote proper spinal column exercise form. One user interface employs a wooden manikin with an integrated inertial measurement unit to provide a tangible user interaction. The other \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Various teleconferencing systems exist, including systems intended for multiple speakers in a conference setting. In such a multiple-speaker setting, a speaker must be localized and tracked in both the video and audio domains. Although many fast, reliable and economical video trackers capable of tracking humans exist, there are very few compact, portable and economical audio localization systems. On the contrary, most available audio localization systems are expensive, non-portable and require extensive audio arrays requiring substantial computational processing. Under the Eyes\u2019n Ears project, a simple, economical and compact method of sound localization for use in a teleconferencing system is being investigated. This paper describes the current status of the Eyes \u2018n Ears project, and summarizes the hardware and software components that make up the system.",

            "Abstract": "One of the problems with geometric (ray) based acoustical modeling approaches is handling the potentially large number of interactions between a propagating sound ray and objects/surfaces it may encounter. A sound ray incident on a surface may be absorbed, reflected both specularly and diffusely, be refracted and diffracted. Typical solutions to modeling such effects include emitting several \u201cnew\u201d rays at each interaction point. Such solutions are computationally expensive for all but very simple environments. Rather than using such deterministic strategies and following these generated rays until they leave the environment or become sufficiently reduced in power that they no longer contribute to the acoustical landscape, probabilistic techniques such as the Russian Roulette strategy can be applied instead. Russian Roulette ensures the path length of each acoustic ray is kept at a manageable size yet allows for paths of arbitrary size to be explored. Here we describe the application of a Russian Roulette approach to acoustic modeling. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the ability of Russian Roulette to provide a computationally reasonable solution to room acoustical modeling.",

            "Abstract": "A longstanding issue among the general public in North America is the lack of awareness about common household fire safety practices and procedures. With the knowledge that virtual simulations and more recently, serious games, can provide environments for individuals to experience and learn from situations that would typically be dangerous and life-threatening, we have developed Blaze, a highly interactive serious game aimed at improving household fire safety awareness. Through exposing the audience to these usually harmful and rare events, initial reaction to common situations, as well as problem-solving under pressure can be experienced safely in a realistic environment.",

Although pedagogical strategies have been developed and implemented rapidly to support cognitive and affective domains of learning in HPE, less progress has occurred in psychomotor skills acquisition. Psychomotor skills, referred to as technical skills training, are underpinned by educational theories and conceptual frameworks. Considering the widening gap in learning domains, this editorial provides an overview and recommendations for developing and implementing remote training supported by educational theories, such as deliberate practice, and conceptual frameworks in technical skills acquisition in HPE.

The transformed data is typically more suitable for regression analysis or classification than the original data. Being of high dimensionality, HRTF data is commonly reduced using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). While highly effective at compressing data that follows the assumed model, PCA compression performance suffers when data follows a nonlinear distribution or when outliers are present. More recent data reduction techniques such as Isomap and locally linear embedding (LLE) take advantage of local neighborhood information in order to learn a more suitable basis for the HRTF data at hand. Quantitative results from previous work indicate that the embedding created by both LLE and Isomap are superior to those obtained with PCA. This paper presents a study that compares sound \u2026",

The design choices made throughout such a process may yield interesting and compelling results. Furthermore, we believe that interaction within a stereoscopic 3D environment is more important than the visual experience itself and therefore, further exploration is needed to take into account the interactive affordances presented by stereoscopic 3D displays.

Typical solutions to modeling these interactions include emitting several\" new\" rays at each interaction point. Such solutions are computationally expensive except for simple environments. Rather than using such deterministic strategies, probabilistic techniques such as Russian Roulette can be applied instead. Russian Roulette ensures the path length of each acoustic ray is kept at a manageable size yet allows for paths of arbitrary size to be explored. Here we describe the application of Russian Roulette to acoustic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of Russian Roulette to provide a computationally reasonable solution to room acoustical modeling.",

            "Abstract": "Although the direct path between a sound source and a receiver is often occluded, sound may still reach the receiver as it diffracts (\" bends\") around the occluding obstacle/object. Diffraction is an elementary means of sound propagation yet, despite its importance, it is often ignored in virtual reality and gaming applications altogether except perhaps for trivial environments. Given the widespread use and availability of computer graphics hardware and the graphics processing unit (GPU) in particular, GPUs have been successfully applied to other, non-graphics applications including audio processing and acoustical diffraction modeling. Here we build upon our previous work that approximates acoustical occlusion/diffraction effects in real-time utilizing the GPU. In contrast to our previous approach, the audio properties of an object are stored as a texture map and this allows the properties to vary across the surface of a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The multiple speaker teleconferencing systems currently available typically focus on a single speaker and provide limited, if any, automatic speaker tracking technologies. However, in a multiple\u2010speaker setting, speakers must be localized and tracked in both the video and audio domains. Although many fast and portable video trackers capable of locating and tracking humans exist, they employ conventional cameras thereby providing a narrow field of view. In addition, audio localization systems are expensive, nonportable, and computationally intensive. Furthermore, there have been very few attempts to combine both audio and visual systems. This work investigates the development of a simple, economical, and compact teleconferencing system utilizing both audio and video cues. An omni\u2010directional video sensor is used to provide a view of the entire visual hemisphere thereby providing multiple dynamic views \u2026",

Recent technological advances in immersive and interactive technologies are providing tools that can be employed to complement traditional medical training methods and techniques. To overcome some of the issues associated with traditional eye examination approaches, our work is examining the application of consumer-level virtual reality technologies to eye fundus examination. Here, we present a cost-effective virtual-reality eye fundus examination virtual simulation tool. Results of a preliminary usability study indicate that the virtual simulation tool provides trainees the opportunity to obtain a greater understanding of the physiological changes within the eye in an interactive, immersive, and engaging manner.",

            "Abstract": "It is no surprise that shadow mapping and its variations are the defacto standard for shadow generation in video games. Shadow maps are easy to compute in real-time and its many variants produce high quality shadows at interactive rates. With simple filtering techniques or by incorporating multiple shadow maps per area light source, soft-shadows can also be produced at interactive rates depending on the scene complexity. Despite these benefits, there are still a number of limitations inherent with shadow mapping-based techniques. More specifically, these algorithms are prone to sampling and aliasing problems, they cannot handle omnidirectional point light sources properly, and they require a shadow map to be rendered for each light source thus limiting the number of shadow-casting lights in the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating shadows that overcomes the issues inherent in \u2026",
