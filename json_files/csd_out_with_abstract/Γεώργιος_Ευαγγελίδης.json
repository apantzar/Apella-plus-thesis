So, the Greek government decided to promote the integration of ICT in these businesses. The aim of the present paper is to describe this nation-wide training system for employees of very small enterprises on the uses of ICT, which presents certain peculiarities. The wide dispersion and lack of homogeneity of the enterprises necessitates that the training system must be decentralised as well as flexible. Also, the employees of very small enterprises are obviously adults and in many cases have absolutely no positive attitudes towards ICT. The particular characteristics of very small enterprises, not only the enterprises as organizations but also their staff, have an effect on the instruction of the trainers who must attend a multi-faceted program which satisfies all the above mentioned requirements and \u2026",

            "Abstract": "One common problem in the scientific research literature is that each one author cannot easily be identified uniquely. The problem arises when there are authors with identical names, authors who have changed their name(s) in the course of time, and authors whose names appear in alternative versions (for example: Jaakko Hyv\u00c3\u00a4rinen, and J. P. Hyv\u00c3\u00a4rinen) across the publications they have (co-) authored. The issue becomes more of a problem when data analysis utilizing author names is to be conducted, for example: in citation analysis. In this paper we introduce the Universal Author Identifier system, codenamed UAI_Sys. The system is web based and publicly available, enabling each one author to register/update his/her own metadata, plus acquire a unique identifier (UAI code), ensuring name disambiguation. As soon as UAI_Sys becomes accepted and enjoys worldwide use, selected author metadata will become globally available to all interested parties. Care is taken so that UAI_Sys comprises more than just a database for storing and handling author identifiers. Provision is taken for the system to incorporate web services facilitating communication with third party applications, thus expanding the possibilities for web based co-functionality. Last but not least, the system supports role-based access and management (i.e. different user roles for authors, librarians, publishers, and administrators) for efficient and effective information dissemination and management, promoting research and collaboration. UAI_Sys is being designed/developed along the lines of the Cascading Citations Analysis Project (C-CAP) which is co-funded by the \u2026",

Today, in mixed reality environments and applications, interaction occupies the joint space between any combination of humans, physical environment, and computers. Although interaction methods and techniques have been extensively examined in recent decades in the field of human-computer interaction, they still should be reidentified in the context of immersive realities. The latest technological advancements in sensors, processing power and technologies, including the internet of things and the 5G GSM network, led to innovative and advanced input methods and enforced computer environmental perception. For example, ubiquitous sensors under a high-speed GSM network may enhance mobile users\u2019 interactions with physical or virtual objects. As technological advancements emerge, researchers create umbrella terms to define their work, such as multimodal, tangible, and collaborative interactions. However, although they serve their purpose, various naming trends overlap in terminology, diverge in definitions, and lack modality and conceptual framework classifications. This paper presents a modality-based interaction-oriented diagram for researchers to position their work and defines taxonomy ground rules to expand and adjust this diagram when novel interaction approaches emerge.",

Model-driven development improves productivity by introducing formal models that can be understood by computers. Through these models the problems of portability, interoperability, maintenance, and documentation are also successfully addressed. However, the problem of evolving requirements, which is more prevalent within the context of business applications, additionally calls for efficient mechanisms that ensure consistency between models and code, and enable seamless and rapid accommodation of changes, without interrupting severely the operation of the deployed application. This paper introduces a framework that supports rapid development and deployment of evolving web-based applications, based on an integrated database schema.

Our approach is based on modeling community evolution by multidimensional time series that describe the changes of each community's properties, both structural and content-based, through time. The prediction framework is based on rule discovery upon the multidimensional time series, so that based on patterns that appear in the evolution of a community's property so far, future behavior can be predicted. Finally, exploiting the similarity between the behavior of a network's communities, their multidimensional time series will be used for community clustering. Thus, rule discovery can also incorporate global rules that appear in clusters of communities as well \u2026",

This paper proposes two effective cluster-based data reduction algorithms for efficient -NN classification. Both have low preprocessing cost and can achieve high data reduction rates while maintaining -NN classification accuracy at high levels. The first proposed algorithm is called reduction through homogeneous clusters (RHC) and is based on a fast preprocessing clustering procedure that creates homogeneous clusters. The centroids of these clusters constitute the reduced training set. The second proposed algorithm is a dynamic version of RHC that retains all its properties and, in addition, it can manage datasets that cannot fit in main memory and is appropriate for dynamic environments where new training data are gradually available.

The proposed method reduces the computational cost as much as possible while maintaining classification accuracy at high levels. The method is based on the well-known -means clustering algorithm and consists of two main parts: (i) a pre-processing algorithm that builds a two-level, cluster-based data structure, and (ii) a hybrid classifier that classifies new items by accessing either the first or the second level of the data structure.

However, a number of pedagogical problems appear when confronted with asynchronous distance education (Ritchie and Hoffman, 1997; Wulf, 1996; Pernici and Casati, 1997; Relan and Gillani, 1997; Hunt 1999; Pritichard, 1998; Khan, 1997; Harasim, 1990; Hall, 1997b; Holden and Wedman, 1993).Students may feel isolated due to the distance factor or due to the lack of live interactions with the tutor or with classmates. On the other hand, due to the discontinuous character of asynchronous distance education, these sessions may also suffer from lack of intense supervision and lack of specialized feedback to students, according to their individual learning needs and preferences. So monitoring students\u2019 performance may become a problematic process, while conclusions about the teaching effectiveness of a particular instructor may also be difficult to draw.",

In many cases, companies and organizations utilize data stored in a variety of data models at remote database servers. A challenge would be to construct queries that join data from such disparate sources. In this paper, we report on research work relating to graphical query languages and data modeling. More specifically, we report on a new software tool for the novice user, one that transforms databases of different data models (Relational, Object-Relational, Object-Oriented) into an equivalent XML model, plus on a new graphical XQuery type query language that facilitates the construction of user queries that join data from different data models.",

Large datasets with high level of noise lead to less accurate classifiers with high computational cost and storage requirements. The goal of editing is to improve accuracy by improving the quality of the training datasets. To obtain such datasets, editing removes noise and mislabeled data as well as smooths the decision boundaries between the discrete classes. On the other hand, prototype abstraction aims to reduce the computational cost and the storage requirements of classifiers by condensing the training data. This paper proposes an editing algorithm called Editing through Homogeneous Clusters (EHC). Then, it extends the idea by introducing a prototype abstraction algorithm that integrate the EHC mechanism and is capable of creating a small noise-free representative set of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Indexing of k-dimensional point data is becoming again a hot research topic because of the need to efficiently index and retrieve high dimensional vectors (points) in data mining applications. The most common query on such vectors is kNN searching, which is a variation of range searching. Most multidimensional indexes for point data follow the paradigm of the ubiquitous B+ tree and store data entries at the leaf level of the index (data nodes). Since this level naturally occupies the majority of nodes in a multidimensional index tree, it is crucial that an index structure achieves the best possible average storage utilization regardless of data distribution and order of data insertion. An additional conflicting goal is the minimization of the index term that is posted at the levels above when data nodes are split. In this paper we revisit data node splitting techniques for point access methods like the KDB-tree, hB-tree, and, in general, any index that stores point data at its leaf level nodes and splits them so that no overlapping subspaces are created at the leaf level. We experiment with various splitting techniques that produce the minimum index term for posting but differ in the shape of the resulting nodes and the average storage utilization. We also test our splitting techniques using uniform and skewed data distributions. The comparison is on the average data node storage utilization and the efficiency of range query searches.",

However, in the context of large datasets many complexity issues arise due to high memory requirements and high computational cost. In the context of the application of Data Mining algorithms, data reduction techniques attempt to reduce the size of training datasets in terms of the number of instances by selecting some of the existing instances or by generating new training instances. The idea is to speed up the application of the data mining algorithm with minimum or no sacrifice in performance. Data reduction techniques have been extensively used in the context of k-Nearest Neighbor classification, a lazy classifier that works by directly using a training dataset rather than building a model.

            "Abstract": "Time series appear frequently in several domains such as in multimedia, business, industry or medicine. A multivariate time series dataset is a set of co-evolving time series that relates to a specific object (eg the motion of a person). The increasing need for analyzing efficiently the huge amount of this information leads to the application of data mining techniques. At the core of these techniques lies the concept of similarity since most of them require searching for similar patterns, such as in query by content, clustering or classification. Nevertheless, when dealing with multivariate time series datasets, similarity should be sought between the whole datasets and not only between the individual time series, since there are usually important correlations among them that shouldn\u2019t be lost. In this paper, we discuss the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on multivariate time series datasets for the purpose of similarity search. PCA is applied in order to reduce the high dimensionality of such data while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the data. We provide a thorough description of the pre-processing phase with respect to PCA assumptions and limitations, as well as, to the most frequently appeared distortions in data. Furthermore, we experimentally explore the potential usefulness of incorporating Piecewise Aggregate Approximation into this phase. Finally, we discuss the various aspects of the proposed PCA-based similarity (dissimilarity) measures.",

One of the most popular classification methods on such data is k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) searching. Unfortunately, all proposed and state-of-the-art multi-attribute indexes fall short in terms of usability as dimensionality increases. This is attributed to the ``dimensionality curse\" problem, according to which, range searching above 10 dimensions is as efficient as a sequential scan of the entire database. Thus, kNN searching, as a special case of range searching, has to benefit a lot if we find ways to increase the performance of indexes in high dimensions. In this paper, we deal with space partitioning indexes and we propose six data node splitting techniques.

To identify each one author uniquely, a Universal Author Identifier (UAI) scheme is established. In addition to the citations directly made to a given (article, author) pair, citation paths that target each one citing article are also considered. The granularity of the paradigm is further increased by introducing the concept of the chord, whereby a citation path of length one co\u2010exists with paths of length two or higher, involving the same source\u2010and target\u2010articles.

            "Abstract": "The inverted file is a popular and efficient method for indexing text databases and is being used widely in information retrieval applications. As a result, the research literature is rich in models (global and local) that describe and compress inverted file indexes. Global models compress the entire inverted file index using the same method and can be distinguished in parameterized and non-parameterized ones. The latter utilize fixed codes and are applicable to dynamic collections of documents. Local models are always parameterized in the sense that the method they use makes assumptions about the distribution of each and every word in the document collection of the text database. In the present study, we examine some of the most significant integer compression codes and propose g-binary, a new non-parameterized coding scheme that combines the Golomb codes and the binary representation of integers. The proposed new coding scheme does not introduce any extra computational overhead when compared to the existing non-parameterized codes. With regard to storage utilization efficiency, experimental runs conducted on a number of TREC text database collections reveal an improvement of about 6% over the existing non-parameterized codes. This is an improvement that can make a difference for very large text database collections.",

As a result, the research literature is rich in models (global and local) that describe and compress inverted file indexes. Global models compress the entire inverted file index using the same method and can be distinguished in parameterized and non-parameterized ones. The latter utilize fixed codes and are applicable to dynamic collections of documents. Local models are always parameterized in the sense that the method they use makes assumptions about the distribution of each and every word in the document collection of the text database. In the present study, we examine some of the most significant integer compression codes and propose g-binary, a new non-parameterized coding scheme that combines the Golomb codes and the binary representation of \u2026",

It is considered to be an effective classifier and has many applications. However, its major drawback is that when sequential search is used to find the neighbors, it involves high computational cost. Speeding-up k-NN search is still an active research field. Hwang and Cho have recently proposed an adaptive cluster-based method for fast Nearest Neighbor searching. The effectiveness of this method is based on the adjustment of three parameters. However, the authors evaluated their method by setting specific parameter values and using only one dataset. In this paper, an extensive experimental study of this method is presented. The results, which are based on five real life datasets, illustrate that if the parameters of the method are carefully defined, one can achieve even better classification performance.",

In this paper, we experiment with state of the art multi-attribute indexing methods and try to investigate when these methods reach their limits, namely, at what dimensionality a kNN query requires visiting all the data pages. In our experiments we compare the Hybrid Tree, the R*-tree, and, the iDistance Method.",

By homogeneous, we refer to clusters where all instances belong to the same class label. Our approach divides the training set into subsets and applies the data reduction algorithm on each separate subset in parallel. Then, the reduced subsets are merged back to the final reduced set. In our experimental study, we split the datasets into 8, 16, 32 and 64 subsets. The results obtained reveal that parallelism can achieve very low preprocessing costs. Also, when the number of subsets is high, in some datasets the accuracy of k-NN classification is almost equal (if not better) to the one achieved when using the standard execution of the reduction algorithms, with a small loss in the reduction rate.",

There is also suggested a new variation of the method and its structure is described, combined with details for materialising the first and the new form of S-Index.

Under specific circumstances, the improved variation of S-Index uses less that 5% of the storage room that occupies the free text indexing database.

IB2 is an    effective prototype selection data reduction technique. It selects some    items from the initial training dataset and uses them as representatives    (prototypes). Contrary to many other techniques, IB2 is a very fast,    one-pass method that builds its reduced (condensing) set in an incremental    manner. New training data can update the condensing set without the need of    the \u201cold\u201d removed items. This paper proposes a variation of IB2, that    generates new prototypes instead of selecting them. The variation is called    AIB2 and attempts to improve the efficiency of IB2 by positioning the    prototypes in the center of the data areas they represent. The empirical    experimental study conducted in the present work as well as the Wilcoxon    signed ranks test show that AIB2 performs better than IB2.",

The model aims to reduce the cost as much as possible and to maintain the classification accuracy at a high level. It consists of a simple data structure and a hybrid, adaptive algorithm that accesses this structure. Initially, a preprocessing clustering procedure builds the data structure. Then, the proposed algorithm, based on user-defined acceptance criteria, attempts to classify an incoming item using the nearest cluster centroids. Upon failure, the incoming item is classified by searching for the k nearest neighbors within specific clusters. The proposed approach was tested on five \u2026",

The problem arises when there are authors with identical names, authors who have changed their name(s) in the course of time, and authors whose names appear in alternative versions (for example: Jaakko Hyv\u00e4rinen, and J. P. Hyv\u00e4rinen) across the publications they have (co-) authored. The issue becomes more of a problem when data analysis utilizing author names is to be conducted, for example: in citation analysis. In this paper we introduce the Universal Author Identifier system, codenamed UAI_Sys. The system is web based and publicly available, enabling each one author to register/update his/her own metadata, plus acquire a unique identifier (UAI code), ensuring name disambiguation. As soon as UAI_Sys becomes accepted and enjoys worldwide use, selected author metadata will become globally available to all interested parties. Care is taken so that UAI_Sys comprises more than just a database for storing and handling author identifiers. Provision is taken for the system to incorporate web services facilitating communication with third party applications, thus expanding the possibilities for web based co-functionality. Last but not least, the system supports role-based access and management (i.e. different user roles for authors, librarians, publishers, and administrators) for efficient and effective information dissemination and management, promoting research and collaboration.

Instance-based classifiers perform adequately when they use only a small subset of such datasets. Larger data volumes introduce high computational cost that prohibits the timely execution of the classification process. Conventional prototype selection and generation algorithms are also inappropriate for data streams and large datasets. In the past, we proposed prototype generation algorithms that maintain a dynamic set of prototypes and are appropriate for such types of data. Dynamic because existing prototypes may be updated, or new prototypes may be appended to the set of prototypes in the course of processing. Still, repetitive generation of new prototypes may result to forming unpredictably large sets of prototypes. In this paper, we propose a new variation of our algorithm that maintains the prototypes in a convenient and manageable way. This is achieved by removing the weakest prototype when a new prototype is generated. The new algorithm has been tested on several datasets. The experimental results reveal that it is as accurate as its predecessor, yet it is more efficient and noise tolerant.",

In this paper, a new fast and non-parametric editing algorithm is proposed. It is called Editing through Homogeneous Clusters (EHC) and is based on an iterative execution of a clustering procedure that forms clusters containing items of a specific class only. Contrary to other editing approaches, EHC is independent of input (tuning) parameters. The performance of EHC is experimentally compared to three state-of-the-art editing algorithms on ten datasets.

Consequently, there is an increasing need for analysing efficiently the huge amount of this information either online or offline. The inherent characteristics of time series data, specifically, the high dimensionality, the high feature correlation and the large amounts of noise led researchers to focus mostly on proposing novel representation schemes for this type of data in order to address the resulting problems. In addition to that, representation schemes have also been proposed for the purpose of exploiting specific methods and algorithms that require different type of data, such as Markov models. Concurrently, since most of the data mining tasks require searching for similar patterns, such as query by content, clustering or classification, many papers have been published that propose a generic or representation-based similarity measure. The objective of this paper is to serve as an overview of the recent approaches and trends in the field of time series data mining representations. It seems that the main interest has been gradually drawn in manipulating streaming data and/or multivariate time series. Although a general overview is included, the literature review is focused mainly on papers of the last four years.",

            "Abstract": "One of the widely used classification algorithms is k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN). Its popularity is mainly due to its simplicity, effectiveness, ease of implementation and ability to add new data in the training set at any time. However, one of its main drawbacks is the fact that its performance is highly dependent on the proper selection of parameter k, i.e. the number of nearest neighbours that the algorithm examines. The most frequently used technique for the \u201cbest\u201d k determination is the cross validation as there is no general rule for choosing the k value due to its dependency on the training dataset. However, selecting a fixed k value throughout the dataset does not take into account its special features, like data distribution, class separation, imbalanced classes, sparse and dense neighborhoods and noisy subspaces. A lot of research has been done to date in the specific field, leading to many k-NN variations. In the \u2026",

It is structured upon a universal database schema (meta-model). The contributions of this paper include a versioning mechanism that enables access to old data in their real context (ie, within the version of the application that created this data), a proposal for selective recompilation of new classes that allows applications to evolve safely at the minimum processing cost, and a policy for handling active classes (ie, classes that have running instances) that need to be dynamically recompiled in order to reflect changes.",

The proposed algorithm is based on a fast pre-processing clustering procedure that creates homogeneous clusters. The centroids of these clusters constitute the reduced training-set. Experimental results, based on real-life datasets, illustrate that the proposed algorithm is faster and achieves higher reduction rates than three known existing methods, while it does not significantly reduce the classification accuracy.",

The advantage is that students use currently dominant programming tools in the market. However novice programmers have problems of comprehension, at least this is reported by the relevant research, and this is due to the complexity of the professional programming development environments for Java and Visual Basic. Moreover, modern programming models, like the object-oriented scheme, are posing a series of additional intellectual obstacles to beginners. Many researchers have suggested special environments for dealing with those problems, specifically designed for introductory teaching. In the present article, the AgentSheets programming environment is proposed for an introduction in objectoriented programming. The AgentSheets environment can have a positive effect in developing the object-oriented thinking for novice programmers. Visual and tactual embedded features, as well as interactivity and feedback capabilities in all development and execution phases, in addition to rapid example implementation are able to successfully interact in the improvement of algorithmic rationale and object-oriented thinking. Therefore, AgentSheets introduces a wide range of educational uses.",

Integer number compression codes are applied on the inverted document id lists to produce compact inverted file indexes. A class of index compression codes that are insensitive to the variations in the statistics of dynamic text collections are the non-parameterized codes. In the present study, we introduce compact-binary (cb): a new non-parameterized coding scheme that combines the Golomb code and the binary representation of integers. The performance of the new code is compared to that of existing popular codes. Experimental results obtained from a number of TREC document collections reveal an overall 7,7% improvement over the most efficient of the existing non-parameterized codes. The outcome is backed by analysis and comprises a significant gain when one considers the large sizes of the target text database collections.",

The main idea is to identify the most similar time series to a given query without necessarily searching over the whole database. Our method is based on partitioning the search space by applying the K-means algorithm on the data. Then, similarity search is performed hierarchically starting from the cluster that lies most closely to the query. This procedure aims at reaching the most similar series without searching all clusters. In this work, we propose to reduce the intrinsically high dimensionality of time series prior to clustering by applying a well known dimensionality reduction technique, namely, the piecewise aggregate approximation, for its simplicity and efficiency.

In real-time applications, efficiency and robustness are more important. To promote these two abilities, we cast the multi-view registration into a clustering task. All the centroids are uniformly sampled from the initially aligned point sets involved in the multi-view registration, which makes it rather efficient and effective for the clustering. Then, each point is assigned to a single cluster and each cluster centroid is updated accordingly. Subsequently, the shape comprised by all cluster centroids is used to sequentially estimate the rigid transformation for each point set. For accuracy and stability, clustering and transformation estimation are alternately and iteratively applied to all point sets. We tested our proposed approach on several benchmark datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art \u2026",

This interweaving has also instigated a vast amount of research in this field. Most research, however, often has as a focal point technology rather than teaching. We believe that technology should not be an end in itself but a medium; to be more exact, it is the didactic situations which must determine the use of technology and not vice versa. In this paper we support the view that the development of new environments and teaching tools, in order for them to contribute substantially to teaching, must undergo didactic analysis.

            "Abstract": "A new citation indexing paradigm is proposed: the cascading citation indexing framework (c2IF, for short). It improves the way research publications are assessed for their impact in promoting science and technology. Given a collection of articles and their citation graph, citations are considered at the (article, author) level. Each one article is uniquely identified by means of the Digital Object Identifier (DOI, http://www.doi.org). To identify each one author uniquely, a Universal Author Identifier (UAI) scheme is established. In addition to the citations directly made to a given (article, author) pair, citation paths that target each one citing article are also considered. The granularity of the paradigm is further increased by introducing the concept of the chord, whereby a citation path of length one co-exists with paths of length two or higher, involving the same source- and target- articles. The c2IF output emerges in the form of a medal standings table, analogous to the one that ranks teams at athletic events: when two (article, author) pairs receive the same number of (direct) citations, the one that is cited by more popular articles (i.e. articles that comprise targets to a larger number of paths in the citation graph), is assigned a higher rank value.",

            "Abstract": "Some of the most commonly used classifiers are based on the retrieval and examination of the k Nearest Neighbors of unclassified instances. However, since the size of datasets can be large, these classifiers are inapplicable when the time-costly sequential search over all instances is used to find the neighbors. The Minimum Distance Classifier is a very fast classification approach but it usually achieves much lower classification accuracy than the k-NN classifier. In this paper, a fast, hybrid and model-free classification algorithm is introduced that combines the Minimum Distance and the k-NN classifiers. The proposed algorithm aims at maximizing the reduction of computational cost, by keeping classification accuracy at a high level. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach can be applicable in dynamic, time-constrained environments.",

            "Abstract": "Data reduction improves the efficiency of k-NN classifier on large datasets since it accelerates the classification process and reduces storage requirements for the training data. IB2 is an effective data reduction technique that selects some training items form the initial dataset and uses them as representatives (prototypes). Contrary to many other data reduction techniques, IB2 is a very fast, one-pass method that builds its reduced (condensing) set in an incremental manner. New training data can update the condensing set without the need of the\" old\" removed items. This paper proposes AIB2, a variation of IB2, which generates new prototypes instead of selecting them. AIB2 attempts to improve the efficiency of IB2 by positioning the prototypes in the center of the data areas they represent. The experimental study shows that AIB2 performs better than IB2.",

This process is accomplished by having the meteorologists analyze the operational data manually. To automate and speed up this procedure we have developed an application in the CLIPS Expert System environment that calculates the observed CDC index. In this paper we examine the appropriate data mining techniques that could be used to extract this index from operational data automatically.",

            "Abstract": "One of the most common difficulties an instructor faces during an introductory course in computer programming, is the lack of appropriate pedagogically efficient \u201ctools\u201d that will help his/her students understand fundamental notions of programming. Especially, complicated notions are, most of the times, only partially taught or left uncovered for a more advanced course. However, the use of modern technology and computers in education, programming included, is not confined only in computer science courses, but finds applications also in sciences like Math, Biology and Sociology. As a result, there has been also a demand for simpler and friendlier software environments that will provide the vehicle of knowledge dissemination for these sciences and, more generally, for education. Starlogo-introduced by Mitchell Resnick at MIT Media Laboratory\u2013is an programming environment that simulates decentralized systems and provides an intuitive interface that can be used even by elementary school students to explore systems and worlds in which thousands of objects participate and interact with each other. Of course this same environment can be used for an introduction to programming and especially to massively parallel programming. In this paper we initially present a number of different approaches that have been used so far by instructors to improve the didactic experience of their students with the power of the Starlogo environment. Using the Starlogo environment, we also organized a series of experimental Starlogo courses. In this paper we present the way these courses were organized and some preliminary results of our experimental approach.",
