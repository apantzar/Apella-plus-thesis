Specialist protein resources fill an important middle ground, providing interactive web interfaces to their databases for a focused topic or family of proteins, using specialized approaches that are not feasible in the major reference databases. Many are labors of love, run by a single lab with little or no dedicated funding and there are many challenges to building and maintaining them. This perspective arose from a meeting of several specialist protein resources and major reference databases held at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus (Cambridge, UK) on August 11 and 12, 2014.

            "Abstract": "Meta-analysis is a popular methodology in several fields of medical research, including genetic association studies. However, the methods used for meta-analysis of association studies that report haplotypes have not been studied in detail. In this work, methods for performing meta-analysis of haplotype association studies are summarized, compared and presented in a unified framework along with an empirical evaluation of the literature. We present multivariate methods that use summary-based data as well as methods that use binary and count data in a generalized linear mixed model framework (logistic regression, multinomial regression and Poisson regression). The methods presented here avoid the inflation of the type I error rate that could be the result of the traditional approach of comparing a haplotype against the remaining ones, whereas, they can be fitted using standard software. Moreover, formal global tests are presented for assessing the statistical significance of the overall association. Although the methods presented here assume that the haplotypes are directly observed, they can be easily extended to allow for such an uncertainty by weighting the haplotypes by their probability. An empirical evaluation of the published literature and a comparison against the meta-analyses that use single nucleotide polymorphisms, suggests that the studies reporting meta-analysis of haplotypes contain approximately half of the included studies and produce significant results twice more often. We show that this excess of statistically significant results, stems from the sub-optimal method of analysis used and, in approximately half of the cases, the \u2026",

This analysis establishes for the first time in Greece and constitutes an important tool for the epidemiological surveillance and control of Campylobacter infection in our country. The MLST genotypes were compared with those gained by other typing methods (HS-typing, PFGE and FlaA typing) and were also phylogenetically analyzed, in order to uncover genetic relationships. Among 68 C. jejuni strains, 41 different MLST-Sequence Types (MLST-STs) were found. Fifty six strains or 34 MLST-STs could be sorted into 15 different MLST-Sequence Type Complexes (MLST-STCs), while twelve strains or seven MLST-STs did not match any of the MLST-STCs of the database. Twenty C. coli strains belonged to 14 different MLST-STs. Eleven MLST-STs were classified in the same MLST-STC (828), and three were unclassifiable. There was no significant association between the MLST-STs and the results of the other typing methods. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that some strains, classified to the species of C. jejuni, formed a separate, phylogenetically distinct group. In eight strains some alleles belonging to the taxonomic cluster of C. jejuni, were also detected in C. coli and vice versa, a phenomenon caused by the genetic mosaic encountered inside the genus Campylobacter. The MLST-ST determination proved to be a very useful tool for the typing as well as the identification of Campylobacter on the species level.",

Because of the significant increase in the published scientific literature in recent years, there has also been an important growth in the number of meta-analyses for a large number of topics [4].

            "Abstract": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been extensively used in computational molecular biology, for modelling protein and nucleic acid sequences. In many applications, such as transmembrane protein topology prediction, the incorporation of limited amount of information regarding the topology, arising from biochemical experiments, has been proved a very useful strategy that increased remarkably the performance of even the top-scoring methods. However, no clear and formal explanation of the algorithms that retains the probabilistic interpretation of the models has been presented so far in the literature. We present here, a simple method that allows incorporation of prior topological information concerning the sequences at hand, while at the same time the HMMs retain their full probabilistic interpretation in terms of conditional probabilities. We present modifications to the standard Forward and Backward algorithms of HMMs and we also show explicitly, how reliable predictions may arise by these modifications, using all the algorithms currently available for decoding HMMs. A similar procedure may be used in the training procedure, aiming at optimizing the labels of the HMM's classes, especially in cases such as transmembrane proteins where the labels of the membrane-spanning segments are inherently misplaced. We present an application of this approach developing a method to predict the transmembrane regions of alpha-helical membrane proteins, trained on crystallographically solved data. We show that this method compares well against already established algorithms presented in the literature, and it is extremely useful in practical \u2026",

Despite the fact that large Universities played a crucial role in establishing Bioinformatics research and education in Greece, we observe that Universities of the periphery invest in the field, by including more relevant courses in the curricula and appointing faculty members trained in the field. In order for us to triangulate we didnt confine ourselves to online resources and descriptive statistics but we also included interviews so as to have a more spherical view of the subject under discussion.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA). We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals. Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone. All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA-and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%\u201394%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic.

Instead of using fixed learning rate for every adjustable parameter of the HMM, we propose the use of independent learning rate/step-size adaptation, which has been proved valuable as a strategy in Artificial Neural Networks training. We show here that our approach compared to standard gradient descent performs significantly better. The convergence speed is increased up to five times, while at the same time the training procedure becomes more robust, as tested on ap-plications from molecular biology.

            "Abstract": "G- Protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest group of eukaryotic cell surface receptors with great pharmacological interest. A broad range of native ligands interact and activate GPCRs, leading to signal transduction within cells. Most of these responses are mediated through the interaction of GPCRs with heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Due to the information explosion in biological sequence databases, the development of software algorithms that could predict properties of GPCRs is important. Experimental data reported in the literature suggest that heterotrimeric G-proteins interact with parts of the activated receptor at the transmembrane helix-intracellular loop interface. Utilizing this information and membrane topology information, we have developed an intensive exploratory approach to generate a refined library of statistical models (Hidden Markov Models) that predict the coupling preference of GPCRs to heterotrimeric G-proteins. The method predicts the coupling preferences of GPCRs to Gs, Gi/o and Gq/11, but not G12/13 subfamilies. Using a dataset of 282 GPCR sequences of known coupling preference to G-proteins and adopting a five-fold cross-validation procedure, the method yielded an 89.7% correct classification rate. In a validation set comprised of all receptor sequences that are species homologues to GPCRs with known coupling preferences, excluding the sequences used to train the models, our method yields a correct classification rate of 91.0%. Furthermore, promiscuous coupling properties were correctly predicted for 6 of the 24 GPCRs that are known to interact with more than one subfamily \u2026",

In this work, we derive an alternative analytic expression for the covariance matrix of the regression coefficients in a multiple linear regression model. In contrast to the well-known expressions which make use of the cross-product matrix and hence require access to individual data, we express the covariance matrix of the regression coefficients directly in terms of covariance matrix of the explanatory variables. In particular, we show that the covariance matrix of the regression coefficients can be calculated using the matrix of the partial correlation coefficients of the explanatory variables, which in turn can be calculated easily from the correlation matrix of the explanatory variables. This is very important since the covariance matrix of the explanatory variables can be easily obtained or imputed using data from the literature, without requiring access to individual data. Two important applications of the method are discussed, namely the multivariate meta-analysis of regression coefficients and the so-called synthesis analysis, and the aim of which is to combine in a single predictive model, information from different variables. The estimator proposed in this work can increase the usefulness of these methods providing better results, as seen by application in a publicly available dataset.

            "Abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors represent the largest and most diverse superfamily of transmembrane receptors in eukaryotic cells, with more than 800 genes encoding such receptors in the human genome. At the interface between the extracellular and intracellular milieu, they are involved in the regulation of nearly every physiological process by converting extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses. Most GPCRs functions are performed by a special group of proteins called G-proteins. G-proteins act as switches for the transduction of messages from the extracellular space inside the cell, through their interaction with GPCRs. G-proteins interact with various effector molecules to immediately change the concentration of cellular molecules, leading eventually to a wide range of cellular and physiological responses.",

A deletion/insertion (4G/5G) polymorphism in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene has been correlated with levels of plasma PAI-1. The 4G allele is associated with higher levels of PAI-1, and might increase the risk for intravascular thrombosis. However, the contribution of this genetic variant to the risk for thrombosis, both arterial and venous, has not been clearly established. A broad spectrum of findings regarding the effect of the 4G allele on thrombotic risk in different target organs has been reported. Our aim is to summarize the variable influence of this polymorphism on thrombotic events in different tissues or organs and explain the underlying mechanisms accounting for these differences.",

A group of extracellular proteins attached to the cell wall contains an LPXTG-like motif that is target for cleavage and covalent coupling to peptidoglycan by sortase enzymes. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was developed for predicting the LPXTG and LPXTG-like cell-wall proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. The model is the first capable of predicting alternative (i.e. other than LPXTG-containing) substrates. Our analysis of 177 completely sequenced genomes identified 1456 cell-wall proteins, a number larger compared to the previously available methods. Among these, apart from the previously identified 1283 proteins carrying the LPXTG motif, we identified 39 newly identified proteins carrying NPXTG, 53 carrying LPXTA and 81 carrying the LAXTG motif.

The prediction of their transmembrane topology, as well as their discrimination in newly sequenced genomes, is of great importance for the elucidation of their structure and function. Several methods have been applied for the prediction of the transmembrane segments and the topology of alpha helical transmembrane proteins utilizing different algorithmic techniques. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been efficiently used in the development of several computational methods used for this task.

The situation is even more complicated in the meta-analysis of GAS or GWAS, in which individual studies are synthesized to derive an overall estimate. Meta-analysis increases the power to detect weak genotype effects, but heterogeneity and incompatibility between the included studies complicate things further.

They play a crucial role in the communication of a cell with the environment. Ligands bind to GPCRs on the outside of the cell, activating them by causing a conformational change, and allowing them to bind to G-proteins. Through their interaction with G-proteins, several effector molecules are activated leading to many kinds of cellular and physiological responses. The great importance of GPCRs and their corresponding signal transduction pathways is indicated by the fact that they take part in many diverse disease processes and that a large part of efforts towards drug development today is focused on them. We present Human-gpDB, a database which currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-proteins and 99 human effectors. The collection of information about the interactions between these molecules was done manually and the current version of Human-gpDB holds information for about 1663 connections between GPCRs and G-proteins and 1618 connections between G-proteins and effectors. Major advantages of Human-gpDB are the integration of several external data sources and the support of advanced visualization techniques. Human-gpDB is a simple, yet a powerful tool for researchers in the life sciences field as it integrates an up-to-date, carefully curated collection of human GPCRs, G-proteins, effectors and their interactions. The database may be a reference guide for medical and pharmaceutical research, especially in the areas of understanding human diseases and chemical and drug discovery.",

A very important aspect of their function is the specific interaction (coupling) with members of four G-protein families. A single GPCR may interact with members of more than one G-protein families (promiscuous coupling). To date all published methods that predict the coupling specificity of GPCRs are restricted to three main coupling groups Gi/o, Gq/11 and Gs, not including G12/13-coupled or other promiscuous receptors. Results: We present a method that combines hidden Markov models and a feed-forward artificial neural network to overcome these limitations, while producing the most accurate predictions currently available. Using an up-to-date curated dataset, our method yields a 94% correct classification rate in a 5-fold cross-validation test. The method predicts also promiscuous coupling \u2026",

Our aim was to examine this association through a detailed meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search for trials published up to June 2009 was performed, reviews of each study were conducted and data were abstracted. Prior to meta-analysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Pooled relative risk estimates (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the fixed- and the random-effects models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.

However, there are biological problems where the Markovian assumption is not sufficient since the sequence context can provide useful information for prediction purposes. Several extensions of HMMs have appeared in the literature in order to overcome their limitations. We apply here a hybrid method that combines HMMs and Neural Networks (NNs), termed Hidden Neural Networks (HNNs), for biological sequence analysis in a straightforward manner. In this framework, the traditional HMM probability parameters are replaced by NN outputs. As a case study, we focus on the topology prediction of for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins.

Ligands bind to GPCRs on the outside of the cell, activating them by causing a conformational change, and allowing them to bind to G-proteins. Through their interaction with G-proteins, several effector molecules are activated leading to many kinds of cellular and physiological responses. The great importance of GPCRs and their corresponding signal transduction pathways is indicated by the fact that they take part in many diverse disease processes and that a large part of efforts towards drug development today is focused on them. We present Human-gpDB, a database which currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-proteins and 99 human effectors.

            "Abstract": "The last 50 years, a variety of archaea and bacteria able to withstand extremely high doses of ionizing radiation, have been discovered. Several lines of evidence suggest a variety of mechanisms explaining the extreme radioresistance of microorganisms found usually in isolated environments on Earth. These findings are discussed thoroughly in this study. Although none of the strategies discussed here, appear to be universal against ionizing radiation, a general trend was found. There are two cellular mechanisms by which radioresistance is achieved: (a) protection of the proteome and DNA from damage induced by ionizing radiation and (b) recruitment of advanced and highly sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms, in order to reconstruct a fully functional genome. In this review, we critically discuss various protecting (antioxidant enzymes, presence or absence of certain elements, high metal ion or salt \u2026",

During the last few years, remarkable advances have been made towards an understanding of their functional and structural features. It is now wellknown that \u00df-barrels are performing a large variety of biologically important functions for the bacterial cell. Such functions include acting as specific or non-specific channels, receptors for various compounds, enzymes, translocation channels, structural proteins, and adhesion proteins.

As a consequence of recent genome projects, there is a wealth of information at the sequence level that lacks any functional annotation. These receptors, often quoted as orphan GPCRs, could potentially lead to novel drug targets. However, typical experiments that aim at elucidating their function are hampered by the lack of knowledge on their selective coupling partners at the interior of the cell, the G-proteins. Up-to-date, computational efforts to predict properties of GPCRs have been focused mainly on the ligand-binding specificity, while the aspect of coupling has been less studied.

Whereas specialised resources for GPCRs, and other groups of receptors, are already available, currently, there is no publicly available database focusing on G Proteins and containing information about their coupling specificity with their respective receptors. gpDB is a publicly accessible G proteins/GPCRs relational database. Including species homologs, the database contains detailed information for 418 G protein monomers (272 G\u03b1, 87 G\u03b2 and 59 G\u03b3) and 2782 GPCRs sequences belonging to families with known coupling to G proteins. The GPCRs and the G proteins are classified according to a hierarchy of different classes, families and sub-families, based on extensive literature searchs. The main innovation besides the classification of both G proteins and GPCRs is the relational model of the database, describing the known coupling specificity of the GPCRs to their respective \u03b1 subunit of G proteins, a unique feature not available in any other database.

The aim of this study was primarily to evaluate the reporting of sample size calculations, to establish the accuracy of these calculations in dental RCTs and to explore potential predictors associated with adequate reporting. Electronic searching was undertaken in eight leading specific and general dental journals. Replication of sample size calculations was undertaken where possible. Assumed variances or odds for control and intervention groups were also compared against those observed. The relationship between parameters including journal type, number of authors, trial design, involvement of methodologist, single-/multi-center study and region and year of publication, and the accuracy of sample size reporting was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Of 413 RCTs identified, sufficient information to allow replication of sample size calculations was provided in only 121 studies (29.3%). Recalculations demonstrated an overall median overestimation of sample size of 15.2% after provisions for losses to follow-up.

With network analysis, looking at biological systems at a higher level in order to better understand a system, its topology and the relationships between its components is of a great importance. Gene expression, signal transduction, protein/chemical interactions, biomedical literature co-occurrences, are few of the examples captured in biological network representations where nodes represent certain bioentities and edges represent the connections between them. Today, many tools for network visualization and analysis are available. Nevertheless, most of them are standalone applications that often (i) burden users with computing and calculation time depending on the network\u2019s size and (ii) focus on handling, editing and exploring a network interactively.

There is considerable evidence that elevated plasma homocysteine levels are associated with a prothrombotic milieu, whereas activation of the coagulation cascade is an important component of the pathogenesis of sepsis. The protein C pathway has been reported to play a central role both in the propagation of sepsis and a hyperhomocysteinemia-induced hypercoagulable state. Our primary aim was to measure plasma homocysteine levels in mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and to assess the association of these levels with relevant clinical outcomes.Methods. The study cohort included 102 mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical data and severity scores were recorded.

However, strict lockdowns have various untintended adverse social, economic and health effects, which have yet to be fully elucidated, and have not been considered in models examining the effects of various mitigation measures. Unlike commonly suggested, the dilemma is not about health vs wealth because the economic devastation of long-lasting lockdowns will definitely have adverse health effects in the population. Furthermore, they cannot provide a lasting solution in pandemic containment, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of consecutive lockdowns with in-between breaks \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Different compartments in a cell perform diverse tasks, thus knowledge of the localization of a protein would be highly indicative of its function. Many proteins have an N-terminal sequence of approximately 20\u201350 residues, which is responsible for their targeting to the appropriate location and is cleaved off, after the protein has been inserted into the organelle. Such information can be used in computational methods predicting protein localization. There are several methods for prediction of protein subcellular location available on the web, with TargetP (Emanuelsson et al 2000) being the most widely used. PredSL is a software tool, which aims to classify proteins to five subcellular locations: chloroplast, thylakoid, mitochondrion, secretory pathway and other. It combines neural networks, Markov chains, HMMs and scoring matrices in order to identify a targeting sequence at the N-terminal of a protein sequence, and determine its type (chloroplast-cTP, mitochondrial-mTP, secreted-SP, thylakoidallTP) and the precise location of the cleavage site. PredSL was tested on a set of 732 plant protein sequences and 637 non-plant sequences and the overall accuracy was 90.4% for the plant set and 93.3% for the non-plant set. Compared to the results obtained by TargetP when tested on the same datasets, PredSL's performance was better by 1.6% for the plant sequences and slightly worse (0.2%) for the non-plant sequences. For the prediction of thylakoid proteins PredSL was tested by cross-validation and achieved 87.3% accuracy compared to 87% by LumenP. PredSL is the only method for protein subcellular localization prediction that is available by the \u2026",

In the current study, we investigated four polymorphisms of the CD24 gene regarding their associations with MS. To this end, univariate and multivariate meta-analysis were applied along with modifications to include data from family-trios so as to increase the robustness of the meta-analysis. We found that the polymorphism 226 C> T (Ala57Val) of the CD24 gene is associated with MS according to the recessive mode of inheritance (odds ratio= 1.75; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.81). Moreover, the 1527\u20131528 TG> del polymorphism is inversely associated with MS according to the dominant mode of inheritance (odds ratio= 0.57; 95% CI 0.39, 0.83). Conversely, the 1056 A> G and 1626 A> G polymorphisms were not found to be associated with MS. We conclude that the CD24 226 C> T polymorphism increases the risk of MS, while the 1527\u20131528 TG> del polymorphism seems to have a protective role against MS, suggesting that these two polymorphisms can be used as predictive biomarkers for MS development.

            "Abstract": " Motivation: Computational prediction of signal peptides is of great importance in computational biology. In addition to the general secretory pathway (Sec), Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts possess another major pathway that utilizes the Twin-Arginine translocase (Tat), which recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal peptides carrying a distinctive pattern of two consecutive Arginines (RR) in the n-region. A major functional differentiation between the Sec and Tat export pathways lies in the fact that the former translocates secreted proteins unfolded through a protein-conducting channel, whereas the latter translocates completely folded proteins using an unknown mechanism. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel method for predicting and discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides at better accuracy. Results: We report the development of a novel method, PRED-TAT, which is \u2026",

Current predictors rely on topogenic signals in the protein sequence, such as the distribution of positively charged residues in extra-membrane loops and the existence of N-terminal signals. However, phosphorylation and glycosylation are post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur in a compartment-specific manner and therefore the presence of a phosphorylation or glycosylation site in a transmembrane protein provides topological information. We examine the combination of phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction with transmembrane protein topology prediction.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the performance of two promising biomarkers, urinary kidney injury molecule 1 (uKIM-1) and Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) in the diagnosis of early diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed by two reviewers until May 2020. For each study, a 2\u00d7 2 contingency table was formulated. Sensitivity, specificity, and other estimates of accuracy were calculated using the bivariate random effects model. The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve hsROC) was used to pool data and evaluate the area under curve (AUC). The sources of heterogeneity were explored by sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was assessed using Deek\u2019s test. The meta-analysis enrolled 14 studies involving 598 healthy individuals, 765 T2DM patients with normoalbuminuria, 549 T2DM patients with microalbuminuria, and 551 T2DM patients with macroalbuminuria, in total for both biomarkers. The AUC of uKIM-1 and YKL-40 for T2DM patients with normoalbuminuria, was 0.85 (95% CI; 0.82\u20130.88) and 0.91 (95% CI; 0.88\u20130.93), respectively. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that both uKIM-1 and YKL-40 can be considered as valuable biomarkers for the early detection of DN in T2DM patients with the latter showing slightly better performance than the former.

Specifically, most of the proposed methods require an appropriate dataset for training, and consequently the results depend heavily on the suitability of the dataset, itself. Motivated by these facts, in this paper we develop a formal discrimination procedure that is based on appropriate theoretical observations on the sequence of hydrophobic and polar residues along the protein sequence and on the exact distribution of a two dimensional runs-related statistic defined on the same sequence. Specifically, for setting up our discrimination procedure, we study thoroughly the exact distribution of a bivariate random \u2026",

A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations. The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N\u2009=\u200922, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations. A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19\u20130.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98\u20131.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88\u20133.94). An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

            "Abstract": "Background Pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 mortality rates varied widely from one country to another. Our aim was to identify potential socioeconomic determinants of pandemic mortality and explain between-country variation.   Methodology Based on data from a total of 30 European countries, we applied random-effects Poisson regression models to study the relationship between pandemic mortality rates (May 2009 to May 2010) and a set of representative environmental, health care-associated, economic and demographic country-level parameters. The study was completed by June 2010.   Principal Findings Most regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant inverse association between pandemic influenza-related mortality and per capita government expenditure on health. The findings were similar in univariable [coefficient: \u20130.00028, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): \u20130.00046, \u20130.00010, p = 0.002] and multivariable analyses (including all covariates, coefficient: \u20130.00107, 95% CI: \u20130.00196, \u20130.00018, p = 0.018).

The pleiotropy of symptoms and the complicated gold-standard methods make the need for non-invasive, highly sensitive diagnostic tests imperative. Individual studies on molecular-based Leishmania diagnosis in urine show high discrepancy; thus, a data-evidenced comparison of various techniques is necessary. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using the bivariate method of diagnostic methods to pool sensitivities and specificities. We investigated the impact of DNA-extraction method, PCR type, amplified locus, host species, leishmaniasis form, and geographical region. The pooled sensitivity was 69.2%. Tests performed with the kit-based DNA extraction method and qPCR outweighed in sensitivity the phenol-chloroform-based and PCR methods, while their combination showed a sensitivity of 79.3%. Amplified locus, human or canine as host and cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis revealed similar sensitivities. Tests in European and Middle Eastern countries performed better than tests in other regions (sensitivity 81.7% vs. 43.7%). A combination of kit-based DNA extraction and qPCR could be a safer choice for molecular diagnosis for Leishmania infection in urine samples in European\u2013Middle Eastern countries.

The regulation of thrombosis, inflammation and cholesterol and lipid metabolism are the main factors that have been proposed thus far to be involved in the pathogenesis of MI. Traditional risk-estimation tools depend largely on conventional risk factors but there is a need for identification of novel biochemical and genetic markers. The aim of the study is to identify differentially expressed genes that are consistently associated with the incidence myocardial infarction (MI), which could be potentially incorporated into the traditional cardiovascular diseases risk factors models. The biomedical literature and gene expression databases, PubMed and GEO, respectively, were searched following the PRISMA guidelines. The key inclusion criteria were gene expression data derived from case-control studies on MI patients from blood samples. Gene expression datasets regarding the effect of medicinal drugs on MI were excluded. The t-test was applied to gene expression data from case-control studies in MI patients.

            "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of the D allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphism in the clinical outcomes of patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) remains controversial. Our aim was to assess simultaneously the effect of the ACE I/D polymorphisms as well as the serum and BALF ACE levels on prognosis of patients with ARDS. METHODS: Sixty-nine mechanically ventilated patients with ALI/ARDS were recruited. ACE activity levels both in serum and BALF were assessed by chemical methods. Patients were genotyped for ACE I/D polymorphisms. Time-to-event analysis evaluated the variables associated with the 28-day and 90-day mortality. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of studies examining the association between ACE I/D polymorphisms and mortality of ALI/ARDS patients. RESULTS: In the multivariable model, age, lung compliance, serum lactate and serum ACE levels were significantly associated with both 28-and 90-day mortality. No significant correlation was found between serum and BALF ACE levels (Spearman's rho= 0.054; P= 0.66). Serum ACE concentrations were significantly higher (P= 0.046) in patients with D/D genotype versus the two other groups combined (I/D and I/I genotypes). The meta-analysis of 6 studies (including ours) provided evidence that D allele is significantly associated with increased mortality in ALI/ARDS patients, yielding a per-allele odds ratio of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.59). CONCLUSION: Serum ACE levels appear to be affected by the I/D polymorphism and are correlated with prognosis in patients with ALI/ARDS indicating that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Some subjects are repeatedly exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), yet they remain uninfected. This suggests the existence of host-resistance mechanisms. The current study synthesizes the evidence regarding the association between interleukin (IL) gene polymorphisms and HIV susceptibility. Medline, Scopus and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched, and a meta-analysis of case-control studies was conducted. Univariate and bivariate methods were used. The literature search identified 42 eligible studies involving 15,727 subjects. Evidence was obtained on eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): IL1A -889 C>T (rs1800587), IL1B +3953/4 C>T (rs1143634), IL4 -589/90 C>T (rs2243250), IL6 -174 G>C (rs1800795), IL10 -592 C>A (rs1800872), IL10-1082 A>G (rs1800896), IL12B -1188 A>C (rs3212227) and IL28B C>T (rs12979860). The IL1B +3953/4 C>T variant appears to increase the risk of HIV acquisition, under the assumption of a recessive genetic model (odds ratio (OR): 4.47, 95% CI: 2.35-8.52). The AA homozygotes of the IL10 -592 C>A SNP had an increased, marginally nonsignificant, risk (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.97-2.01). It reached, however, significance in sub analyses (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.04-2.12). Finally, the well-studied hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection IL28B (rs12979860) CT/TT genotypes were associated with a 27% decrease in HIV infection risk, especially in populations infected with HCV (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.95). Interleukin signalling is perhaps important in HIV infection and some interleukin genetic variants may affect the risk of HIV acquisition. Approaches targeting specific \u2026",

The traditional way to perform such experiments is to design oligonucleotide hybridization probes that correspond to specific genes and then measure the expression of the genes in order to determine which of them are up- or down-regulated compared to a condition that is used as a control. Hitherto, individual experiments cannot capture the bigger picture of how a biological system works and, therefore, data integration from multiple experimental studies and external data repositories is necessary to understand the function of genes and their expression patterns under certain conditions.

We estimated the shared SNP heritability and performed a bivariate GWAS meta-analysis of total-body lean mass (TB-LM) and total-body less head bone mineral density (TBLH-BMD) regions in 10,414 children. The estimated SNP heritability is 43%(95% CI: 34\u201352%) for TBLH-BMD, and 39%(95% CI: 30\u201348%) for TB-LM, with a shared genetic component of 43%(95% CI: 29\u201356%). We identify variants with pleiotropic effects in eight loci, including seven established bone mineral density loci: WNT4, GALNT3, MEPE, CPED1/WNT16, TNFSF11, RIN3, and PPP6R3/LRP5. Variants in the TOM1L2/SREBF1 locus exert opposing effects TB-LM and TBLH-BMD, and have a stronger association with the former trait. We show that SREBF1 is expressed in murine and human \u2026",

However, the Markovian assumption regarding transition probabilities which dictates that the observed symbol depends only on the current state may not be sufficient for some biological problems. In order to overcome the limitations of the first order HMM, a number of extensions have been proposed in the literature to incorporate past information in HMMs conditioning either on the hidden states, or on the observations, or both. Here, we implement a simple extension of the standard HMM in which the current observed symbol (amino acid residue) depends both on the current state and on a series of observed previous symbols. The major advantage of the method is the simplicity in the implementation, which is achieved by properly transforming the observation sequence, using an extended alphabet. Thus, it \u2026",
