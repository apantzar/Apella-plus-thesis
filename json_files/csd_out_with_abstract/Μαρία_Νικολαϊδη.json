            "Abstract": "This paper develops an ecological stock-flow-fund (ESFF) modelling framework that provides an integrated platform for the analysis of the interactions between the ecosystem, the financial system and the macroeconomy. The ESFF framework has three distinct features. First, it formulates explicitly the monetary stocks and flows and the physical stocks and flows taking into account the accounting principles and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, it pays particular attention to the distinction between stock-flow resources and fund-service resources and formulates the interaction of funds with monetary and physical stocks and flows. Third, it allows an explicit analysis of the various stock-flow-fund channels through which the stability of the ecosystem, the financial system and the macroeconomy are interconnected. The paper illustrates how the ESFF framework can form the basis for the combined examination of ecological, financial and macroeconomic issues. In so doing, the suggested framework contributes to the development of an ecological macroeconomics in which finance plays a nonneutral role and physical and monetary variables are examined in an interconnected and consistent way.",

Fourth, fiscal policies that boost green investment amplify the transition risks of the GSF and reduce the transition risks of the DPF; the combination of green fiscal policy with the DPF is thereby a potentially effective climate policy mix from a financial stability point of view.",

The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016\u20132120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability \u2026",

The model consists of a Northern and a Southern region. The Northern region is characterised by high export capacity and a large tradable sector while the Southern region has limited export capacity and a small tradable sector. Our preliminary simulation analysis shows that an increase in the credit inflows from the Northern region into the Southern region leads to a temporary increase in economic growth in the Southern region. However, this is accompanied by an increase in the leverage of firms and an increase in the current account deficit that ultimately lead to lower economic growth. Similar effects are found in the case in which there is a reduction in the interbank interest rate at which the Southern commercial banks borrow. Our model is also used to examine the effects of wage, fiscal and macroprudential policies on financial fragility and current account imbalances.",

We provide empirical evidence that clearly shows the growing financial fragility of the Greek public sector in the 2000s. We also assess the effectiveness of the implemented bailout adjustment programmes in Greece and claim that the conducted austerity measures and fiscal consolidation have not significantly improved the financial posture of the Greek government sector. We argue that the implementation of fiscal and wage austerity in an economy that lacks structural competitiveness produces prolonged recession and unemployment with adverse feedback effects on the financial fragility of the government.",

            "Abstract": "Christine Lagarde, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), has recently promised to explore every avenue for greening the ECB\u2019s operations, including its quantitative easing (QE) programme. Yet the current corporate QE programme remains biased towards carbon-intensive sectors: these sectors are over-represented in the ECB purchases, when compared to their contribution to the euro area employment and economic activity. An important consequence of the carbon bias is that it may lower the cost of borrowing (an implicit subsidy) and encourage more debt issuance by the most carbon intensive firms relative to low-carbon firms. By favouring access to finance for highly polluting companies, this carbon bias is an important barrier to the decarbonisation of the euro area economies. We argue that the ECB should abandon its market neutrality approach, the key driver of this carbon bias, and adopt alternative low-carbon strategies. We suggest two such strategies in which carbon-intensive bonds are replaced with more climate-friendly bonds. These strategies would significantly reduce the climate footprint of the ECB corporate QE and would make companies\u2019 access to finance more aligned with the targets of the Paris Agreement.",

We show that (i) carbon taxes reduce global warming but increase financial risks due to their adverse effects on the profitability of firms and credit availability; (ii) green subsidies and green public investment improve ecological efficiency, but their positive environmental impact is partially offset by their macroeconomic rebound effects; and (iii) a green fiscal policy mix derives better outcomes than isolated policies.

One key novelty of the model is that it integrates cross-country effects of changes in both income distribution and fiscal policy. The model is used to estimate econometrically the effects of income distribution and fiscal policy on the components of aggregate demand and the budget balance in EU15 countries. The results show that a simultaneous increase in the wage share in all EU15 countries would increase demand and the primary budget balance in all countries. A simultaneous increase in government spending turns out to boost economic activity in all the EU15 countries, indicating the positive economic effects of expansionary fiscal policy. Moreover, a progressive tax policy that would be implemented simultaneously at the EU level would lead to an increase in output in all countries.",

Furthermore, as modern financial markets are increasingly organised around collateral, central banks\u2019 treatment of collateral\u2013the terms on which they accept bonds or loans posted by banks\u2013sends a powerful signal to private financial markets. Central banks\u2019 collateral rules have significant knock-on effects for monetary and financial conditions in the wider economy.The collateral framework of the Eurosystem\u2212 the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro area national central banks\u2212 is at the heart of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy implementation.

This paper investigates two issues that have not been addressed in Basel III and which are of particular importance for the attainment of a more effective liquidity regulation. The first is the need for a dynamic definition of liquidity that takes into account the time-varying liquidity and stability of banks\u2019 balance sheet items. The paper develops a new liquidity ratio that explicitly considers this changing nature of liquidity, by assigning weights that depend on financial risks and perceptions. The ratio is estimated and assessed for the EMU-12 countries. The second issue is the need for macro fragility-related liquidity requirements. We provide empirical evidence which suggests that the banking sector does not self-impose such requirements. Based on this evidence, it is argued that the regulatory agents should introduce a positive link between bank liquidity and macroeconomic fragility.",

We show that the fiscal austerity measures do not produce a substantial decline in the financial fragility of the public sector; they also set the stage for chronic financial instability in the economy.

It has been argued that by implementing such a programme central banks could contribute to the fight against climate change. Our recent research shows that a green QE programme that involves the purchase of green corporate bonds can indeed reduce global warming. The programme will be more effective if green investment responds strongly to changes in the interest rates. Yet, green QE cannot by itself prevent severe climate change: even with optimistic assumptions about the role of interest rates, the path of global atmospheric temperature is not very likely to change substantially by such a programme. Many other types of environmental policies and strategies are necessary to keep global warming close to 2\u00b0 C.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this thesis is to shed some new theoretical and empirical light on the issues of financial fragility and instability of the macroeconomic systems. The thesis consists of four independent essays. The first essay develops a macrodynamic model in which firms\u2019 and banks\u2019 desired margins of safety play a central role in macroeconomic performance. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations illustrate that the endogeneity of the desired margins of safety during the investment cycles is conducive to instability. Moreover, it is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomic system. The second essay explores, via a stock-flow consistent model, the macroeconomic channels through which securitisation and wage stagnation can jointly affect financial fragility. The results from simulation experiments provide support to the view that the combination of risky financial practices and higher inequality can substantially increase the likelihood of financial instability in the macro system. The third essay proposes a new bank liquidity ratio that explicitly considers the time-varying nature of liquidity by assigning weights on banks\u2019 balance sheet items that depend on financial risks and perceptions. This ratio is estimated and assessed for the EMU-12 countries. Furthermore, the essay investigates the link between macroeconomic fragility and bank liquidity for the EMU. The empirical results suggest that banks in the EMU do not self-impose higher liquidity requirements when macroeconomic fragility increases. The fourth essay puts forward a liquidity index that extends Minsky\u2019s well-known financial taxonomy of economic \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The rapid decarbonization of the UK economy requires a wider range of policies, from fiscal interventions to a green industrial strategy, a green plan for a National Investment Bank and environmental regulations that will restrict carbon-intensive consumption. These policies need to be accompanied by a rapid transformation of the UK financial system.The UK\u2019s official Green Finance Strategy, published by the Conservative government in July 2019, does not go far enough. It offers a market-led, too much carrot, too little stick, deregulated decarbonisation approach. Yet an ambitious transition to low-carbon will not take place via the market because of a series of market failures that include incompatible time horizons between private finance and climate crisis, incomplete capital markets, corporate market power, and subjective private classifications of green assets. To climate-align private finance, we offer a set of recommendations that aim to (i) establish a robust institutional framework,(ii) green Bank of England/commercial banking and (iii) green shadowbanking/market-based finance (see Figure 1).",

            "Abstract": "Securitisation and wage stagnation have been viewed as two main root causes of the global financial crisis. This paper develops a stock-flow consistent model that allows the investigation of the macroeconomic channels through which securitisation and wage stagnation can jointly affect financial fragility. Particular attention is paid to their role in enhancing a borrowing-induced expansion, a housing boom and an appreciation in the prices of mortgage-backed securities that are of temporary nature. The results from simulation experiments provide support to the view that the combination of risky financial practices with wage stagnation can increase the likelihood of financial instability in a macro system.",

            "Abstract": "This paper develops a stock-flow consistent model that encompasses a three-sector financial system and explicitly integrates the process of securitization into the workings of the macroeconomy. An endogenously determined rate of default on loans is introduced and the implications of securitization for the credit availability to households are explicitly analyzed. The model pays particular attention to the dynamic interplay between the housing market and the financial sector in order to illuminate, among others, the interconnection between household lending and the developments in the securities market. With the aid of simulations it explores the channels through which exogenous institutional changes within the financial system are likely to generate financial fragility and to eventually bring about instability in the economy.",

            "Abstract": "The idea of a green QE (quantitative easing) programme has gained a lot of traction over the last years. It has been argued that by implementing such a programme central banks could contribute to the fight against climate change. Our recent research shows that a green QE programme that involves the purchase of green corporate bonds can indeed reduce global warming. The programme will be more effective if green investment responds strongly to changes in the interest rates. Yet, green QE cannot by itself prevent severe climate change: even with optimistic assumptions about the role of interest rates, the path of global atmospheric temperature is not very likely to change substantially by such a programme. Many other types of environmental policies and strategies are necessary to keep global warming close to 2 degrees Celsius.",

            "Abstract": "According to the new governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, aligning the Bank\u2019s corporate bond purchase scheme with the government\u2019s climate goals is a \u2018perfectly sensible thing to do\u2019 and should be made a \u2018priority\u2019. Yet in its current framework, the pandemic corporate bond purchase programme is heavily biased towards carbon-intensive sectors \u2013 and thus at odds with the government\u2019s environmental objectives. This carbon bias means the programme may lower the cost of borrowing (an implicit subsidy) and encourage more debt issuance by the most carbon-intensive firms relative to low-carbon firms. To help support the governor\u2019s efforts, this briefing sets out two alternative purchase strategies \u2013 the \u2018Lower-carbon pandemic QE\u2019 scenario and the \u2018Low-carbon pandemic QE\u2019 scenario \u2212 that would help decarbonise the Bank\u2019s corporate bond purchases (boosting green investment in the process) and ensure that the Bank\u2019s policy interventions are consistent with its rhetoric.",

The model incorporates an active banking sector and pays particular attention to the leverage of both firms and banks. It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired margins of safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity of the desired margins of safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Fiscal policy has a strong role to play in the transition to an ecologically sustainable economy. This paper critically discusses the way that green fiscal policy has been analysed in both conventional and post-Keynesian approaches. It then uses a recently developed post-Keynesian ecological macroeconomic model in order to provide a comparative evaluation of three different types of green fiscal policy: carbon taxes, green subsidies and green public investment. We show that (i) carbon taxes reduce global warming but increase financial risks due to their adverse effects on the profitability of firms and credit availability; (ii) green subsidies and green public investment improve ecological efficiency, but their positive environmental impact is partially offset by their macroeconomic rebound effects; and (iii) a green fiscal policy mix derives better outcomes than isolated policies. Directions for future heterodox macroeconomic research on the links between fiscal policy and ecological sustainability are suggested.",
