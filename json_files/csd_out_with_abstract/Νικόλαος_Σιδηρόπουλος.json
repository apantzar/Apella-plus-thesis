This paper proposes a new algorithm for general QCQP. The problem is first reformulated in consensus optimization form, to which the alternating direction method of multipliers can be applied. The reformulation is done in such a way that each of the subproblems is a QCQP with only one constraint (QCQP-1), which is efficiently solvable irrespective of (non)convexity. The core components are carefully designed to make the overall algorithm more scalable, including efficient methods for solving QCQP-1, memory efficient implementation, parallel/distributed implementation, and smart initialization. The proposed algorithm is then tested in two \u2026",

However, the extraordinary effectiveness of NMF in analyzing real-life nonnegative data has sparked a substantial amount of research in many fields. The linear algebra community has shown interest in nonnegative matrices and nonnegative matrix factorization (known as nonnegative rank factorization) since more than thirty years ago [3].

The problem is known to be NP-hard, and is also very difficult to approximate, in the worst-case. In this paper, we present a new convex relaxation for the problem. Our key idea is to reformulate DkS as minimizing a submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. Exploiting the fact that submodular functions possess a convex, continuous extension (known as the Lovasz extension), we propose to minimize the Lovasz extension over the convex hull of the cardinality constraints. Although the Lovasz extension of a submodular function does not admit an analytical form in general, for DkS we show that it does. We leverage this result to develop a highly scalable algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers \u2026",

However, sending analog or finely quantized signal sample streams to a fusion center is a burden in distributed sensing scenarios. Instead, it is appealing to estimate the frequency lines from a few randomly filtered broadband power measurement bits taken using a network of cheap sensors. This leads to a new problem: line spectrum estimation from inequalities. Three different techniques are proposed for this estimation task. In the first two, the autocorrelation function is first estimated nonparametrically, then a parametric method is used to estimate the sought frequencies. The third is a direct maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation approach that uses coordinate descent. Simulations show that the underlying frequencies can be accurately estimated using the proposed techniques, even from relatively few \u2026",

The new architecture is based on parallel processing of a set of randomly compressed, reduced-size replicas of the big tensor. Each replica is independently decomposed, and the results are joined via a master linear equation per tensor mode.

            "Abstract": "Most learning approaches treat dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering separately (ie, sequentially), but recent research has shown that optimizing the two tasks jointly can substantially improve the performance of both. The premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but in practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and possibly nonlinear function. To recover theclustering-friendly\u2019latent representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network\u2019s ability to approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and propose an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated optimization problem. Experiments using different real datasets are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

When there are many co-channel users and/or the service constraints are stringent, the problem becomes infeasible and some form of admission control is necessary. We advocate a cross-layer approach to joint multiuser transmit beamforming and admission control, aiming to maximize the number of users that can be served at their desired QoS. The core problem is NP-hard, yet amenable to convex approximation tools. We propose a computationally efficient semidefinite relaxation algorithm which works remarkably well in a range of experiments, using both simulated and measured channel data.",

MF is commonly used to obtain item embeddings and feature representations due to its ability to capture correlations and higher-order statistical dependencies across dimensions. In many applications, the categories of items exhibit a hierarchical tree structure. For instance, human diseases can be divided into coarse categories, e.g., bacterial, and viral. These categories can be further divided into finer categories, e.g., viral infections can be respiratory, gastrointestinal, and exanthematous viral diseases. In e-commerce, products, movies, books, etc., are grouped into hierarchical categories, e.g., clothing items are divided by gender, then by type (formal, casual, etc.). While the tree structure and the categories of the different items may be known in some applications, they have to be learned together with the embeddings in many others. In this work, we propose eTREE, a model that incorporates the (usually ignored) tree structure to enhance the quality of the embeddings. We leverage the special uniqueness properties of Nonnegative MF (NMF) to prove identifiability of eTREE. The proposed model not only exploits the tree structure prior, but also learns the hierarchical clustering in an unsupervised data-driven fashion. We derive an efficient algorithmic solution and a scalable implementation of eTREE that exploits parallel computing, computation caching, and warm start strategies. We showcase the effectiveness of eTREE on real data from various application domains: healthcare, recommender systems, and education. We also \u2026",

High-resolution localization is then achieved via either quadrilinear regression of four-way data generated by capitalizing on both spatial and temporal shift invariance or a new maximum likelihood (ML)-based two-dimensional (2-D) harmonic retrieval algorithm. The latter option achieves the best-known model identifiability bound while remaining close to the Cramer-Rao bound even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Following beamforming using the recovered directions, a dynamic programming approach is developed for joint ML estimation of signal \u2026",

We show that an optimal vector in a least-squares sense can be found by solving a convex problem, thus establishing a hidden convexity in Fourier phase retrieval. We then show that the standard semidefinite relaxation approach yields the optimal cost function value (albeit not necessarily an optimal solution). A method is then derived to retrieve an optimal minimum phase solution in polynomial time. Using these results, a new measuring technique is proposed which guarantees uniqueness of the solution, along with an efficient algorithm that can solve large-scale Fourier phase retrieval problems with uniqueness and optimality guarantees.",

Existing PARAFAC algorithms are computationally demanding and operate in batch mode - both serious drawbacks for on-line applications. When the data are serially acquired, or the underlying model changes with time, adaptive PARAFAC algorithms that can track the sought decomposition at low complexity would be highly desirable. This is a challenging task that has not been addressed in the literature, and the topic of this paper. Given an estimate of the PARAFAC decomposition of a tensor at instant t, we propose two adaptive algorithms to update the decomposition at instant t+1, the new tensor being obtained from the old one after appending a new slice in the 'time' dimension. The proposed algorithms can yield estimation performance that is very close \u2026",

In this paper, we propose PHASED, an optimization approach for energy disaggregation that has two key features: PHASED (i) exploits the structure of power distribution systems to make use of readily available measurements that are neglected by existing methods, and (ii) poses the problem as a minimization of a difference of sub-modular functions. We leverage this form by applying a discrete optimization variant of the majorization-minimization algorithm to iteratively minimize a sequence of global upper bounds of the cost function to obtain high-quality approximate solutions. PHASED improves the disaggregation accuracy of state-of-the-art models by up to 61% and achieves better prediction on heavy load \u2026",

We show that the optimal importance function that minimizes the variance of the particle weights can be computed in closed form, and develop procedures to draw samples from it.

Nevertheless, when the linear mixtures are distorted by unknown nonlinear functions - which is well-motivated and more realistic in many cases - the associated identifiability issues are far less studied. This work proposes an identification criterion for a nonlinear mixture model that is well grounded in many real-world applications, and offers identifiability guarantees.

However, most existing channel estimation work under the DD model has not considered DP arrays, perhaps because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank four-way tensor, and thus the parameters can be effectively estimated via tensor decomposition algorithms.

The problem has a rich variety of applications, the most notable being hyperspectral unmixing in remote sensing and non-negative matrix factorization in machine learning. PRISM uses a simple probabilistic model, namely, uniform simplex data distribution and additive Gaussian noise, and it carries out inference by maximum likelihood. The inference model is sound in the sense that the vertices are provably identifiable under some assumptions, and it suggests that PRISM can be effective in combating noise when the number of data points is large. PRISM has strong, but hidden, relationships with simplex volume minimization, a powerful geometric approach for the same problem. We study these fundamental aspects, and we also consider algorithmic schemes based on importance sampling and variational inference. In particular, the variational inference scheme is shown to resemble a matrix factorization problem with a special regularizer, which draws an interesting connection to the matrix factorization approach.

A memory-efficient and computationally lightweight algorithm is proposed for the classic MAX-VAR GCCA formulation, which is gaining renewed interest in various applications, such as speech recognition and natural language processing. The MAX-VAR GCCA problem can be solved optimally via eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the (whitened) correlation matrices of the views. However, this route can easily lead to memory explosion and a heavy computational burden when the size of the views becomes large. Instead, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm, which avoids instantiating the correlation matrices of the views and thus can achieve substantial saving in memory. The algorithm also maintains data sparsity, which can be exploited to alleviate the computational burden. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is highly scalable. Despite the non-convexity of the MAX-VAR GCCA problem, the proposed iterative algorithm is shown to converge to a globally optimal solution under certain mild conditions. The proposed framework ensures global convergence even when the subproblems are inexactly solved, which can further reduce the complexity in practice.

Radar has long been a staple of signal processing, and MIMO radar presents challenges and opportunities in adapting classical radar imaging tools and developing new ones. Our aim in this article is to showcase the potential of tensor algebra and multidimensional harmonic retrieval (HR) in signal processing for MIMO radar. Tensor algebra and multidimensional HR are relatively mature topics, albeit still on the fringes of signal processing research. We show they are in fact central for target localization in a variety of pertinent MIMO radar scenarios. Tensor algebra naturally comes into play when the coherent processing interval comprises multiple pulses, or multiple transmit and receive subarrays are used (multistatic configuration).

            "Abstract": "Synchronization is fundamental to the proper operation of communication networks. Synchronization may be performed at various levels: from very coarse to very fine-grained; the required accuracy depends upon the application and the network environment, and hence can change dynamically. For example, coarse time synchronization suffices for many detection and tracking applications, but finer synchronization is required for high data-rate communication, distributed array processing, analog to digital conversion (ADC), slot synchronization, and cooperative communications. According to Wikipedia, synchronization is timekeeping which requires the coordination of events to operate a system in unison. The familiar conductor of an orchestra serves to keep the orchestra in time. Systems operating with all their parts in synchrony are said to be synchronous or in sync. Some systems may be only approximately synchronized, or plesiochronous. For some applications relative offsets between events need to be determined, for others only the order of the events is important. The aim of synchronization may be different in different applications, as illustrated next.\u2022 Reliable coherent digital communication systems require accurate synchronization, particularly when the data rate or bandwidth is large. Synchronization consists of a number of tasks. First, carrier synchronization aims at generating a reference carrier with a phase that closely matches that of the data signal, thus compensating for the effects of oscillators mismatch and Doppler effects. This generated carrier is used at the receiver to perform coherent demodulation of the received signal to \u2026",

In practice, the performance of these estimators degrades severely when the window size deviates beyond a certain range. The optimal window size for window-based estimators is hard to determine and track in practice due to the continuously changing fading environment. Based on a first-order autoregressive model of the shadow process, we propose a scalar Kalman-filter-based approach for improved local mean power estimation, with only slightly increased computational complexity.

However, most existing channel estimation work under the DD model has not yet considered DP arrays, perhaps because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank tensor, and thus the key parameters of the channel can be effectively estimated via tensor decomposition algorithms.

            "Abstract": "In topic modeling, many algorithms that guarantee identifiability of the topics have been developed under the premise that there exist anchor words -- i.e., words that only appear (with positive probability) in one topic. Follow-up work has resorted to three or higher-order statistics of the data corpus to relax the anchor word assumption. Reliable estimates of higher-order statistics are hard to obtain, however, and the identification of topics under those models hinges on uncorrelatedness of the topics, which can be unrealistic. This paper revisits topic modeling based on second-order moments, and proposes an anchor-free topic mining framework. The proposed approach guarantees the identification of the topics under a much milder condition compared to the anchor-word assumption, thereby exhibiting much better robustness in practice. The associated algorithm only involves one eigen-decomposition and a few small linear programs. This makes it easy to implement and scale up to very large problem instances. Experiments using the TDT2 and Reuters-21578 corpus demonstrate that the proposed anchor-free approach exhibits very favorable performance (measured using coherence, similarity count, and clustering accuracy metrics) compared to the prior art.",

            "Abstract": "Node representation learning is the task of extracting concise and informative feature embeddings of certain entities that are connected in a network. Many real world network datasets include information about both node connectivity and certain node attributes, in the form of features or time-series data. Modern representation learning techniques utilize both connectivity and attribute information of the nodes to produce embeddings in an unsupervised manner. In this context, deriving embeddings that preserve the geometry of the network and the attribute vectors would be highly desirable, as they would reflect both the topological neighborhood structure and proximity in feature space. While this is fairly straightforward to maintain when only observing the connectivity or attributed information of the network, preserving the geometry of both types of information is challenging. A novel tensor factorization approach for node embedding in attributed networks that preserves the distances of both the connections and the attributes is proposed in this paper, along with an effective and lightweight algorithm to tackle the learning task. Judicious experiments with multiple state-of-art baselines suggest that the proposed algorithm offers significant performance improvements in node classification and link prediction tasks.",

In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discretetime difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county-and statelevel COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction.",

We propose SCOUP-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments, we find that SCOUP-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend SCOUP-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply SCOUP-SMT to BRAINQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension. SCOUPSMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy.

Specifically, we model the interactions between the N input variables and the scalar output of a system by a single N-way tensor, and setup a weighted low-rank tensor completion problem with smoothness regularization which we tackle using a block coordinate descent algorithm. We extend our method to the multi-output setting and the case of partially observed data, which cannot be readily handled by neural networks.

            "Abstract": "A parallel algorithm for low-rank tensor decomposition that is especially well-suited for big tensors is proposed. The new algorithm is based on parallel processing of a set of randomly compressed, reduced-size `replicas' of the big tensor. Each replica is independently decomposed, and the results are joined via a master linear equation per tensor mode. The approach enables massive parallelism with guaranteed identifiability properties: if the big tensor has low rank and the system parameters are appropriately chosen, then the rank-one factors of the big tensor will be exactly recovered from the analysis of the reduced-size replicas. The proposed algorithm is proven to yield memory / storage and complexity gains of order up to IJ/F for a big tensor of size I \u00d7 J \u00d7 K of rank F with F \u2264I \u2264J \u2264K.",

The problem is of interest in military communications, where, in addition to frequency, hop timing may also be randomly shifted to guard against unauthorized reception and jamming. We have recently proposed (Sidiropoulos et al., 2006) a conceptually simple stochastic state-space model that captures the randomness in carrier frequency and hop timing, and is well- suited for application of particle filtering tools. In this contribution, we generalize the approach in (Sidiropoulos et al., 2006) to the multichannel case. In particular, we show that the importance function that minimizes the variance of particle weights can again be computed in closed form. The resulting multichannel particle filters are assessed and compared to their single-channel counterparts in pertinent simulation experiments.",

Infeasibility is a key issue in this context, due to power or mutual interference limitations. We therefore consider the joint multicast beamforming and admission control problem for one or more co-channel multicast groups, with the objective of maximizing the number of subscribers served and minimizing the power required to serve them.

More often than not, linear (e.g., spreading) diversity is employed, i.e., each diversity branch provides a linear combination of the unknown signals, albeit with possibly unknown weights. If multiple forms of linear diversity are simultaneously available, then the resulting data exhibit multilinear structure, and the blind recovery problem can be shown to be tantamount to low-rank decomposition of the multi-dimensional received data array. This paper generalizes Kruskal's fundamental result on the uniqueness of low-rank decomposition of 3-way arrays to the case of multilinear decomposition of 4- and higher-way arrays. The result characterizes diversity combining for blind identifiability when N forms of linear diversity are available; that is the balance between \u2026",

The starting point is to leverage the spatial structure of the BS antenna array to reshape the channel matrix in tensor form, and then bring in orthonormal Tucker (also known as multilinear / higher-order SVD) factorization to approximate the channel tensor on the UE side, and feed the obtained factors back to the BS. The resulting decomposition results in a significant reduction in the number of parameters that needs to be fed back from each UE to its serving BS, without sacrificing channel estimation accuracy.

SDR has the drawback of squaring the number of variables, which lifts the problem to much higher dimension and renders SDR ill-suited for large-scale ULS/UQP.

This paper shows, perhaps surprisingly, that if the joint PMF of any three variables can be estimated, then the joint PMF of all the variables can be provably recovered under relatively mild conditions.

It localizes the centroids of data clusters via estimating modes of the probability distribution that generates the data points, using the\" optimal\" Epanechnikov kernel density estimator. However, since the procedure involves non-smooth kernel density functions, the convergence behavior of Epanechnikov mean shift lacks theoretical support as of this writing---most of the existing analyses are based on smooth functions and thus cannot be applied to Epanechnikov Mean Shift. In this work, we first show that the original Epanechnikov Mean Shift may indeed terminate at a non-critical point, due to the non-smoothness nature. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple remedy to fix it. The modified Epanechnikov Mean Shift is guaranteed to terminate at a local maximum of the estimated density, which corresponds to a cluster centroid, within a inite number of iterations. We also propose a way to avoid running the Mean Shift iterates from every data point, while maintaining good clustering accuracies under non-overlapping spherical Gaussian mixture models. This further pushes Epanechnikov Mean Shift to handle very large and high-dimensional data sets. Experiments show surprisingly good performance compared to the Lloyd's K-means algorithm and the EM algorithm.",

Sum capacity, quality of service, and fair service objectives were considered, under unicast and multicast scenarios. A key innovation of our work is the concept of physical layer multicasting, which affords significant capacity gains.

The BSS problem is formulated as a conjugate-symmetric PARAFAC model that is fitted optimally, using an efficient alternating least-squares algorithm that converges monotonically. The identifiability properties of the model are also presented, revealing the much broader identifiability potential of joint-diagonalization- based BSS methods. In order to focus on estimation performance, perfect resolution of the permutation ambiguity is assumed. Simulations under varying reverberation conditions and comparison with previous estimation methods that are widely used in BSS problems demonstrate significant performance gains. Signal-to- interference (SIR) ratio improvement of over 27 dB is achieved using PARAFAC. Average SIR gains of 2.5 and 6.3 dB are achieved compared to state-of-the-art \u2026",

Recent work has shown that any joint Probability Mass Function (PMF) can be represented as a naive Bayes model, via Canonical Polyadic (tensor rank) Decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a low-rank tensor model of the joint PMF of all variables and indirect targeting as a way of mitigating complexity and maximizing the classification performance for a given number of features. Through low-rank modeling of the joint PMF, it is possible to circumvent the curse of dimensionality by learning principal components of the joint distribution. By indirectly aiming to predict the latent variable of the naive Bayes model instead of the original target variable, it is possible to formulate the feature selection problem as maximization of a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint - which can be tackled using a greedy algorithm that comes with performance guarantees. Numerical experiments with several standard datasets suggest that the proposed approach compares favorably to the state-of-art for this important problem.",

This is critical in multi-modal data fusion and analytics, where samples from a single view may not be enough for meaningful DR. In this work, we focus on a popular formulation of GCCA, namely, MAX-VAR GCCA. The classic MAX-VAR problem is optimally solvable via eigen-decomposition, but this solution has serious scalability issues. In addition, how to impose regularizers on the sought canonical components was unclear - while structure-promoting regularizers are often desired in practice. We propose an algorithm that can easily handle datasets whose sample and feature dimensions are both large by exploiting data sparsity. The algorithm is also flexible in \u2026",

Early sparsity-aware signal processing techniques have mostly targeted stationary signal analysis using offline algorithms for signal and image reconstruction from Fourier samples. On the other hand, sparsity-aware time-frequency tools for nonstationary signal analysis have recently received growing attention. In this context, sparse regression has offered a new paradigm for instantaneous frequency estimation, over classical time-frequency representations. Standard techniques for estimating model parameters from time series yield erroneous fits when, e.g., abrupt changes or outliers cause model mismatches.

As antenna elements are becoming smaller and cheaper in the mmW range compared to radio frequency (RF) chains, it is crucial to perform antenna selection at the transmitter, such that the available RF chains are switched to an appropriate subset of antennas. This paper considers the joint problem of multicast beamforming and antenna selection for a single multicast group in massive MIMO systems. The prior state-of-art for this problem relies on semi-definite relaxation (SDR), which cannot scale up to the massive MIMO regime.

The Gaussian components in the mixture model user clusters of different means (locations) and variances (spreads). It is shown that minimizing outage probability subject to a transmit power constraint is an NP-hard problem when the number of Gaussian kernels, J, is greater than or equal to the number of transmit antennas, N. Through dimensionality reduction, it is also shown that the problem is practically tractable for 2 - 3 Gaussian kernels. An approximate solution based on the Markov inequality is also proposed.

            "Abstract": "Co-clustering is a generalization of unsupervised clustering that has recently drawn renewed attention, driven by emerging data mining applications in diverse areas. Whereas clustering groups entire columns of a data matrix, co-clustering groups columns over select rows only, i.e., it simultaneously groups rows and columns. The concept generalizes to data \u201cboxes\u201d and higher-way tensors, for simultaneous grouping along multiple modes. Various co-clustering formulations have been proposed, but no workhorse analogous to  K -means has emerged. This paper starts from  K -means and shows how co-clustering can be formulated as a constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. For three- and higher-way data, uniqueness of the multilinear decomposition implies that, unlike matrix co-clustering, it is possible to unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters.

However, in some applications of phase retrieval, an unknown subset of the measurements can be seriously corrupted by outliers, where LS is not robust and will degrade the estimation performance severely. This paper presents an Alternating Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (AIRLS) method for phase retrieval in the presence of such outliers. The AIRLS employs two-block alternating optimization to retrieve the signal through solving an \u2113 p -norm minimization problem, where 0 <; p <; 2. The Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) for Laplacian as well as Gaussian noise is derived for the measurement model considered, and simulations show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in heavy-tailed noise.",

            "Abstract": "Effective non-parametric density estimation is a key challenge in high-dimensional multivariate data analysis. In this paper,we propose a novel approach that builds upon tensor factorization tools. Any multivariate density can be represented by its characteristic function, via the Fourier transform. If the sought density is compactly supported, then its characteristic function can be approximated, within controllable error, by a finite tensor of leading Fourier coefficients, whose size de-pends on the smoothness of the underlying density. This tensor can be naturally estimated from observed realizations of the random vector of interest, via sample averaging. In order to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we introduce a low-rank model of this characteristic tensor, which significantly improves the density estimate especially for high-dimensional data and/or in the sample-starved regime. By virtue of uniqueness of low-rank tensor decomposition, under certain conditions, our method enables learning the true data-generating distribution. We demonstrate the very promising performance of the proposed method using several measured datasets.",

This paper presents a promising new method for blind (power) spectra separation and emitter direction finding using a network of cognitive radios. Each radio has a pair of antennas, and the baselines of different radios are aligned (e.g., using a compass), in a configuration reminiscent of classical spatial correlation-based ESPRIT.

Since joint admission and power control is NP-hard, a host of heuristics have been proposed and implemented over the years, mostly based on the concept of gradual removals. More recently, the joint problem was revisited from a better-motivated Lagrangian relaxation/convex approximation viewpoint.

Tensor factorization methods can also be used to handle such challenging cases, but it is hard to solve the associated optimization problems.

Traditional spectrum sensing for dynamic spectrum sharing is mostly concerned with detecting or estimating the aggregate spectrum. Spectra separation can be considered as a further step towards full awareness of the radio frequency (RF) environment, which may enable judicious routing, scheduling and beamforming with more effective interference avoidance. In other applications such as geoscience, astronomy, and chemometrics, separating the spectra of the objects/analytes from the sensed mixtures is also of great interest.

            "Abstract": "The biological processes involved in a drug's mechanisms of action are oftentimes dynamic, complex and difficult to discern. Time-course gene expression data is a rich source of information that can be used to unravel these complex processes, identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and predict the response to a drug. However, the majority of previous work has not fully utilized this temporal dimension. In these studies, the gene expression data is either considered at one time-point (before the administration of the drug) or two timepoints (before and after the administration of the drug). This is clearly inadequate in modeling dynamic gene-drug interactions, especially for applications such as long-term drug therapy. In this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework for drug response prediction by taking advantage of time-course gene expression data. Our goal is to predict drug response values at every stage of a long-term treatment, given the expression levels of genes collected in the previous time-points. To this end, REP employs a built-in recursive structure that exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past values of drug responses for subsequent predictions. It also incorporates tensor completion that can not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing data, but also predict unseen gene expression levels (GELs). These advantages enable REP to estimate drug response at any stage of a given treatment from some GELs measured in the beginning of the treatment.

            "Abstract": "The major contribution of this thesis is on the problem of transmit beamforming to multiple cochannel multicast groups. Two viewpoints are considered: i) minimizing total transmission power while guaranteeing a prescribed minimum signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) at each receiver; and ii) a \u201cfair\u201d approach maximizing the overall minimum SINR under a total power budget. The core problem is a multicast generalization of the multiuser downlink beamforming problem; the difference is that each transmitted stream is directed to multiple receivers, each with its own channel. Such generalization is relevant and timely, eg, in the context of the emerging WiMAX and UMTS-LTE wireless networks. The joint multicast beamforming problem is in general NP-hard, motivating the pursuit of computationally efficient quasi-optimal solutions. In chapter 1, it is shown that semidefinite relaxation coupled with suitable randomization/cochannel multicast power control yield computationally efficient high-quality approximate solutions.The multicast beamforming problem is revisited in chapter 2 for the important special case when the channel vectors are Vandermonde. This arises when a uniform linear antenna array is used at the transmitter under far-field line-of-sight propagation conditions, as provisioned in 802.16 e and related wireless backhaul scenarios. It is shown that for Vandermonde channel vectors it is possible to recast the optimization in terms of the autocorrelation sequences of the sought beamvectors, yielding an equivalent convex reformulation. This affords efficient optimal solution using modern interior point methods. The optimal \u2026",

Unlike the state-of-the-art methods such as those based on one-bit compressive sensing, AR takes a different approach. It accounts for the lost amplitudes of the one-bit quantized measurements, and performs channel estimation and amplitude completion jointly. This way, the direction information of the propagation paths can be estimated via accurate direction finding algorithms in array processing, e.g., maximum likelihood. The upsot is that AR is able to handle off-grid angles and provide more accurate channel estimates. Simulation results are included to showcase the advantages of AR.",

In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses. We show that this is an instance of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem. We propose Scoup-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments, we find that Scoup-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend Scoup-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply Scoup-SMT to BrainQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension. Scoup-SMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of Scoup-SMT, by applying it on a Facebook dataset (users, friends, wall-postings); there, Scoup-SMT spots spammer-like anomalies.",

This observation suggests a very simple approach for extracting large quasi-cliques: simply scan the vertex neighborhoods, compute the clustering coefficient of each vertex, and output the best such subgraph. The implementation of such a method requires counting the triangles in a graph, which is a well-studied problem in graph mining. When empirically tested across a number of real-world graphs, this approach reveals a surprise: vertex neighborhoods include maximal cliques of non-trivial sizes, and the density of the best neighborhood often compares favorably to \u2026",

However, since a Lidar outputs a large amount of data every fraction of a second, it is progressively harder to process the information in real-time. Consequently, current systems have migrated towards faster alternatives at the expense of accuracy. To overcome this inherent trade-off between latency and accuracy, we propose a technique to develop topological maps from Lidar data using the orthogonal Tucker3 tensor decomposition.

It relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled since, when neural activity increases in an brain area, the metabolic demands in this area rise. Thus, the vascular system concentrates oxygen (oxygenated hemoglobin) into the area.In fMRI, a brain is represented by a finite set of volume elements (voxels). For each voxel, we have a time series that indicates the concentration of oxygen in this area over time. These time series are known as blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. The purpose of task-based fMRI data analysis is to determine which brain areas are activated when a specific task is performed, based on the BOLD signals analysis. Hence, brain activation maps related to specific tasks can be obtained. This procedure is very useful for understanding how the human brain works. Also, the study of how brain activations maps, as well as how activation time patterns change over different trials, can be used for diagnostic purposes. For example, fMRI could provide an in vivo means to investigate alterations in brain function related to the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, possibly before development of significant irreversible structural damage. The BOLD signal of a voxel corresponds to oxygenation changes that are not only related to the specific task that we study but also to irrelevant factors.

The first technique is based on the PARAFAC fitting trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) regression procedure, while the second one makes use of the joint approximate diagonalization algorithm. These techniques do not require any knowledge of the propagation channel and/or sensor array manifold and are applicable to a more general class of scenarios than earlier blind approaches to spatial signature estimation.",

The problem is that hop timing estimates derived from the spectrogram are coarse and unreliable, thus severely limiting performance. In this paper we take a fresh look at this problem, based on sparse linear regression (SLR). At any point in time, there are only few active carriers; and carrier hopping is rare for slow FH. Using a dense frequency grid, we formulate the problem as under-determined linear regression with a dual sparsity penalty \u2026",

Formal analysis of the stability and maximum stable throughput for xNDMA protocols is difficult, because the associated Markov chain is non-separable multidimensional. We tackle this problem for BNDMA.

In contrast, the proposed approach fixes the embedding of the'target'graph and jointly optimizes the embedding transformation and the alignment of the'query'graph. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed for computing high-quality approximate solutions and compared against the prevailing state-of-the-art graph aligning frameworks using benchmark real-world graphs. The results indicate that the proposed formulation can offer significant gains in terms of matching accuracy and robustness to noise relative to existing solutions for this hard but important problem.",

Many may have little idea of his work or how influential he was, but Richard was actually one of a handful of co-founders of what is called three-way data analysis (linear algebra for analyzing data \u2018boxes\u2019), and both the father and Godfather of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)\u2014which is arguably the most important three-way decomposition due to its remarkable uniqueness properties. Richard was the first to recognize the importance of uniqueness and prove the first results. His early PhD papers (1970\u20131972) in UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics are true landmarks, with several hundred citations each. For many years, three-way analysis in general, and PARAFAC in particular, remained on rather obscure territory\u2014in the hands of a few psychometricians and applied mathematicians (-in-disguise). Yet Richard never gave up on his program; he continued to pursue his ideas and make important contributions to three-way analysis right until his untimely death. In the early 1990s, people in chemometrics discovered the power of PARAFAC and three-way analysis, and put it to good use. Several other disciplines followed: signal processing, digital communications, databases, internet search, and, finally,\u2018mainstream\u2019linear algebra.

This paper provides crosstalk models derived from measured data for quad cable, lengths between 75 and 590 meters, and frequencies up to MHz. The results indicate that the log-normal statistical model (with a simple parametric law for the frequency-dependent mean) fits well up to MHz for both FEXT and NEXT. This extends earlier log-normal statistical modeling and validation results for NEXT over bandwidths in the order of a few MHz.

Each rank-1 array is defined by the outer product of three vectors a (r), b (r) and c (r), ie y ijk (r)= a i (r) b j (r) c k (r). These vectors make up the R columns of the component matrices A, B and C. If 2R+ 2 is less than or equal to the sum of the k-ranks of A, B and C, then the fitted part of the decomposition is unique up to a change in the order of the rank-1 arrays and rescaling/counterscaling of each triplet of vectors (a (r), b (r), c (r)) forming a rank-1 array. This classical result was shown by Kruskal. His proof is, however, rather inaccessible and does not seem intuitive.

Such generalization is relevant and timely, e.g., in the context of 802.16 wireless networks. Based on earlier results for a single multicast group, the joint problem is easily shown to be NP-hard, a fact that motivates the pursuit of quasi-optimal computationally efficient solutions. It is shown that Lagrangian relaxation coupled with a randomization/co-channel multicast power control loop yields a computationally efficient high-quality approximate solution.

Examples include hop period and timing estimation, wherein hops may be missed at the output of the frequency discriminator or the emitter may hop out of band; Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI) analysis; and passive rotating-beam radio scanning. We study several pertinent period estimators. Our emphasis is on a Quasi-Maximum Likelihood approach developed herein and an earlier method based on the Fourier Transform of a Dirac delta train representation of the data. Surprisingly, both are capable of attaining the clairvoyant Crame/spl acute/r-Rao Bound at moderate signal-to-noise \u2026",

We first revisit the well-known lack of identifiability in this case, and point out that there always exists a solution that is minimum phase, even though the desired signal is not. Next, we explain how the least-squares formulation of this problem can be optimally solved via PhaseLift followed by spectral factorization, and this solution is always minimum phase. A simple approach is then proposed to circumvent non-identifiability: adding an impulse to an arbitrary complex signal (offset to the Fourier transform) before taking the quadratic measurements, so that a minimum phase signal is constructed and thus can be uniquely estimated. Simulations with synthetic data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

A network sensing scenario comprising low-end sensors is considered, with each sensor reporting a single randomly filtered power measurement bit to the fusion center (FC), which estimates the ambient power spectrum from these bits. An adaptive thresholding algorithm is proposed to improve the quality and speed of power spectrum reconstruction. Upon receipt of each new bit, the FC picks the threshold for the next sensor so as to cut off a half-space from the feasible region along its Chebyshev center. Convergence of this algorithm to the true finite-length autocorrelation is shown, whose Fourier transform yields the power spectrum estimate. To avoid the `downlink' threshold communication overhead, an alternative algorithm is proposed, where each sensor pseudo-randomly chooses its threshold from a suitable distribution, and \u2026",

Based on plaid models which allow for overlapping submatrices, the present paper develops a sparsity-cognizant overlapping co-clustering (SOC) approach. Numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the novel SOC scheme to globally detect multiple overlapping co-clusters, outperforming the original plaid model algorithms which rely on greedy search and ignore sparsity.",

This article explores how the transmitter can learn to beam-form on-the-fly from very low-rate channel quality indicator bits fed back from the receiver, while transmitting payload at the same time. The setup is tuned to low-latency scenarios where the receiver has limited capabilities, and is paired up opportunistically with the transmitter.

A drawback is that existing implementations are centralized, whereas practical power control has to be distributed across the network.

This paper proposes a joint dimensionality reduction and non-parametric density estimation framework, using a novel estimator that can explicitly capture the underlying distribution of appropriate reduced-dimension representations of the input data. The idea is to jointly design a nonlinear dimensionality reducing auto-encoder to model the training data in terms of a parsimonious set of latent random variables, and learn a canonical low-rank tensor model of the joint distribution of the latent variables in the Fourier domain. The proposed latent density model is non-parametric and universal, as opposed to the predefined prior that is assumed in variational auto-encoders. Joint optimization of the auto-encoder and the latent density estimator is pursued via a formulation which learns both by minimizing a combination of the negative log-likelihood in the latent domain and the auto-encoder reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves very promising results on toy, tabular, and image datasets on regression tasks, sampling, and anomaly detection.",

Multicast beamforming was recently proposed as a means of exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to boost spectral efficiency and meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Infeasibility is a key issue in this context, due to power or mutual interference limitations. We therefore consider the joint multicast beamforming and admission control problem for one or more co-channel multicast groups, with the objective of maximizing the number of subscribers served and minimizing the power required to serve them. The problem is NP-hard even for an isolated multicast group and no admission control; but drawing upon our earlier work for the multiuser SDMA downlink, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that yields good solutions at affordable worst-case complexity. For the special case of an isolated multicast, Lozano proposed a particularly simple adaptive algorithm for implementation in UMTS-LTE. We identify strengths and drawbacks of Lozano\u2019s algorithm, and propose two simple but worthwhile improvements.

            "Abstract": "The single-group multicast beamforming problem is NP-hard, and the available approximations do not always achieve favorable performance-complexity tradeoffs. This paper introduces a new class of adaptive multicast beamforming algorithms that features guaranteed convergence and state-of-the-art performance at low complexity. Each update takes a step in the direction of an inverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighted linear combination of the SNR-gradient vectors of all the users. Convergence of this update to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of proportionally fair beamforming is established. Simulations show that the proposed approach can enable better performance than the prior state-of-art in terms of multicast rate, at considerably lower complexity. This reveals an interesting link between max-min-fair and proportionally fair multicast beamforming formulations. For cases where there is no initial \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Providing reliable service to users close to the edge between cells remains a challenge in cellular systems, even as 5G deployment is around the corner. These users are subject to significant signal attenuation, which also degrades their uplink channel estimates. Even joint detection using base station (BS) cooperation often fails to reliably detect such users, due to near-far power imbalance, and channel estimation errors. Is it possible to bypass the channel estimation stage and design a detector that can reliably detect cell-edge user signals under significant near-far imbalance? This paper shows, perhaps surprisingly, that the answer is affirmative--albeit not via traditional multiuser detection. Exploiting that cell-edge user signals are weak but {\\em common} to different base stations, while cell-center users are unique to their serving BS, this paper establishes an elegant connection between cell-edge user detection \u2026",

With known integer regressors, the problem is classical linear regression. In many applications, however, the actual regressors are unknown; only categorical information (i.e., the regressors are integers) and, perhaps, loose bounds are available. Examples include hop timing estimation, pulse repetition interval (PRI) analysis, and passive rotating-beam radio scanning. With unknown regressors, this seemingly simple problem exhibits many surprising twists. Even for small sample sizes, a proposed quasi-maximum likelihood approach essentially meets the clairvoyant CRB at moderately high SNR - the latter assumes knowledge of the unknown regressors. This is quite unusual, and it holds despite the fact that our algorithm ignores noise color. We outline analogies and differences \u2026",

In the case of two-sided (union and intersection) noise we now know that this is no longer the case: in this more general setting, as it turns out, optimal estimators are not increasing operators [4].

Various MIMO wireless techniques, such as the BLAST system [5], and space-time coding [35], have been proposed and drawn much attention lately. In practice, attaining the benefits predicted by information theory requires parsimonious modeling and accurate estimation of the MIMO wireless channel. Good channel models and associated channel estimation enable fading mitigation and diversity combining at the receiver, and/or transmit optimization when channel information is fed back to the transmitters. In addition, good models are also useful to service providers for infrastructure layout and service provisioning purposes. To this end, numerous spatial wireless channel models have been developed (see [4] for an overview) in an effort to predict the effects of the actual wireless channel without directly measuring it. On one hand, these models must adequately capture the complicated electromagnetic propagation environment resulting from reflection, scattering, diffraction",

This is an old nonlinear estimation problem that has recently drawn interest in the signal processing community, due to the emergence of wireless sensor networks. Sensor maps are useful for estimating the spatial distribution of measured phenomena, and for routing purposes. We propose a two-stage algorithm that combines algebraic initialization and gradient descent. In particular, we borrow an algebraic solution known as Fastmap from the database literature, adapt it to the sensor network context, and motivate the placement of anchor/pivot nodes on the edges of the network. When all nodes can estimate their distance from the anchors, the overall algorithm offers very competitive performance at low complexity (quadratic in the number of nodes).",

The models considered here are a linear regression model, and its natural one-bit counterpart where measurements are additionally quantized to a single bit. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We start by providing conditions for identification and the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) for these two models.

The new algorithm is particularly suitable for cases where the available sample size is large enough to accurately estimate second-order output probabilities, but not higher-order ones. We show that if one is only able to obtain a reliable estimate of the pairwise co-occurrence probabilities of the emissions, it is still possible to uniquely identify the HMM if the emission probability is sufficiently scattered. We apply our method to hidden topic Markov modeling, and demonstrate that we can learn topics with higher quality if documents are modeled as observations of HMMs sharing the same emission (topic) probability, compared to the simple but widely used bag-of-words model.",

This problem is motivated by several applications. For example, given the breakdown of energy consumption at some homes, how can we disaggregate the total energy consumed during the same period at other homes? In order to address this challenge, we propose GRATE, a principled method that turns the ill-posed task at hand into a constrained tensor factorization problem. Then, this optimization problem is tackled using an alternating least-squares algorithm. GRATE has the ability to handle exact aggregated data as well as inexact aggregation where some unobserved quantities contribute to the aggregated data. Special emphasis is given to the energy disaggregation problem where the goal is to provide energy breakdown for consumers from their monthly aggregated consumption. Experiments on two real datasets show the efficacy of GRATE in recovering more accurate disaggregation than state-of-the-art energy disaggregation methods.",

            "Abstract": "Massive MIMO is currently a leading physical layer technology candidate that can dramatically enhance throughput in 5G systems, for both unicast and multicast transmission modalities. As antenna elements are becoming smaller and cheaper in the mmW range compared to radio frequency (RF) chains, it is crucial to perform antenna selection at the transmitter, such that the available RF chains are switched to an appropriate subset of antennas. This paper considers the joint problem of multicast beamforming and antenna selection for a single multicast group in massive MIMO systems. The prior state-of-art for this problem relies on semi-definite relaxation (SDR), which cannot scale up to the massive MIMO regime. A successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach is proposed to tackle max-min fair joint multicast beamforming and antenna selection. The key idea of SCA is to successively approximate the \u2026",

We show that this leads naturally to a model in which routing algorithms are described by the evolution of a Markov chain enabling the definition of deliverability criteria in terms of absorbing states. We further introduce optimal routing protocols by selecting the routing matrix from a convex polygon containing all feasible routing matrices. The criteria of optimality include minimization of the packet error probability for a given delay bound and the minimization of the average packet delay. These metrics are correspondingly meaningful in the context of real time transmissions - e.g., voice and/or video - and delay insensitive data - e.g., file transfers.",

Our method, MUSCLES, adapts to changing correlations among time sequences. It can handle indefinitely long sequences efficiently using an incremental algorithm and requires only small amount of storage and less I/O operations. To make it scale for a large number of sequences, we present a variation, the Selective MUSCLES method and propose an efficient algorithm to reduce the problem size. Experiments on real datasets show that MUSCLES outperforms popular competitors in prediction accuracy up to 10 times, and discovers interesting correla-tions. Moreover, Selective MUSCLES scales up very well for large numbers of sequences, reducing response time up to 110 times over MUSCLES, and sometimes even improves the prediction quality.",

Second, most algorithms assume that the degradation operators from the super-resolution image to the HSI and MSI are known or can be easily estimated - which is hardly true in practice.

For example, a location-disease-time tensor of case counts can have multiple delayed updates of recent temporal slices for some locations or diseases. Recovering such missing or noisy (under-reported) elements of the input tensor can be viewed as a generalized tensor completion problem. Existing tensor completion methods usually assume that i) missing elements are randomly distributed and ii) noise for each tensor element is i.i.d. zero-mean. Both assumptions can be violated for spatio-temporal tensor data. We often observe multiple versions of the input tensor with different under-reporting noise levels. The amount of noise can be time- or location-dependent as more updates are progressively introduced to the tensor. We model such dynamic data as a multi-version tensor with an extra tensor mode capturing the data updates. We propose a low-rank tensor model to predict the updates over time. We demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the ground-truth values of many real-world tensors. We obtain up to 27.2% lower root mean-squared-error compared to the best baseline method. Finally, we extend our method to track the tensor data over time, leading to significant computational savings.",

Since then, little has been achieved that might further qualify Kruskal's sufficient condition. Attempts to prove that it is also necessary for uniqueness (except for rank 1 or 2) have failed, but counterexamples to necessity have not been detected. The present paper gives a method for generating the class of all solutions (or at least a subset of that class), given a CP solution that satisfies certain conditions. This offers the possibility to examine uniqueness for a great variety of specific CP solutions. It will be shown that Kruskal's condition is necessary and sufficient when the rank of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We propose a general algorithmic framework for constrained matrix and tensor factorization, which is widely used in signal processing and machine learning. The new framework is a hybrid between alternating optimization (AO) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): each matrix factor is updated in turn, using ADMM, hence the name AO-ADMM. This combination can naturally accommodate a great variety of constraints on the factor matrices, and almost all possible loss measures for the fitting. Computation caching and warm start strategies are used to ensure that each update is evaluated efficiently, while the outer AO framework exploits recent developments in block coordinate descent (BCD)-type methods which help ensure that every limit point is a stationary point, as well as faster and more robust convergence in practice. Three special cases are studied in detail: non-negative matrix/tensor \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Multidimensional harmonic retrieval (HR) problems often appear in the context of MIMO wireless channel sounding. In particular, for a double-directional parametric MIMO channel model with uniform linear transmit and receive arrays, and a fixed wireless scenario (static - no Doppler), fitting the channel model parameters amounts to a 3D harmonic retrieval problem. For this latter problem, we develop two new algorithms. One is based on conjugate-folding of the 3D data and reduction to an eigenvalue decomposition problem; the other on a 3D version of the rank reduction estimator (RARE) applied to a subspace extracted from a single data snapshot, using 3D conjugate-folding. Both algorithms remain operative close to the best known model identifiability boundary. The two algorithms are compared via pertinent simulations.",

The vectoring benefit is evaluated under the assumption of transmit precompensation for the elimination of self-far-end crosstalk, and echo cancellation of self-near-end crosstalk.

In particular, we address the issue of what to do when there are multiple languages in the corpus. Prior work has, among other techniques, used canonical correlation analysis to project pre-trained vectors in two languages into a common space. We propose a simple and scalable method that is inspired by the notion that the learned vector representations should be invariant to translation between languages. We show empirically that our method outperforms prior work on multilingual tasks, matches the performance of prior work on monolingual tasks, and scales linearly with the size of the input data (and thus the number of languages being embedded).",

            "Abstract": "The K-means clustering problem seeks to partition the columns of a data matrix in subsets, such that columns in the same subset are 'close' to each other. The co-clustering problem seeks to simultaneously partition the rows and columns of a matrix to produce 'coherent' groups called co-clusters. Co-clustering has recently found numerous applications in diverse areas. The concept readily generalizes to higher-way data sets (e.g., adding a temporal dimension). Starting from K-means, we show how co-clustering can be formulated as constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. In the case of three- and higher-way data, this corresponds to a PARAFAC decomposition with sparse latent factors. This is important, for PARAFAC is unique under mild conditions and sparsity further improves identifiability. This allows us to uniquely unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters that are \u2026",

Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) is a well-known landmark in the area of high-resolution array processing. This chapter is devoted to the problem of high-resolution localization and tracking of multiple Frequency-Hopped (FH) signals. It presents two basic approaches. One relies on hop detection preprocessing to isolate hop-free subsets of the temporal data. The second approach tackles the joint problem of multiuser hop timing and angle-carrier estimation, using a combination of dynamic programming and multidimensional harmonic retrieval. The chapter reviews some fundamentals on rank and low-rank decomposition of matrices and higher-way arrays. It reviews basic PARAFAC \u2026",

Prior work has focused on using Semi-Definite relaxation (SDR) techniques in an attempt to obtain a high quality sub-optimal solution. However, SDR suffers from the drawback of having high computational complexity, as SDR lifts the problem to higher dimensional space, effectively squaring the number of variables. This paper proposes a high performance, low complexity Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) algorithm for max-min SNR \u201cfair\u201d joint multicast beamforming and antenna selection under a sum power constraint. The proposed approach relies on iteratively approximating the non-convex objective with a series of non-smooth convex subproblems, and then, a first order-based method called Saddle Point Mirror-Prox (SP-MP) is used to compute optimal solutions for each SCA subproblem.

            "Abstract": "Well appreciated at the physical layer, user cooperation is introduced here as a diversity enabler for wireless random access (RA) at the medium access control sublayer. This is accomplished through a two-phase protocol in which active users start with a low power transmission attempting to reach nearby users and follow up with a high power transmission in cooperation with the users recruited in the first phase. We show that such a cooperative protocol yields a significant increase in throughput. Specifically, we prove that for networks with a large number of users, the throughput of a cooperative wireless RA network operating over Rayleigh-fading links approaches the throughput of an RA network operating over additive white Gaussian noise links-thus justifying the title of the paper. The message borne out of this result is that user cooperation offers a viable choice for migrating diversity benefits to the wireless RA \u2026",
