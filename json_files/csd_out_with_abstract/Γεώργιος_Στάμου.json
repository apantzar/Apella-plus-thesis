Our objective is to minimize the consumption over a trip without impacting the overall trip time. The system uses a particular segmentation of the route and involves a three-step procedure. In the first step, a neural network is trained on telemetry data to model the consumption of the vehicle based on its velocity and the surface gradient. In the second step, two Q-learning algorithms compute the optimum velocities and the racing line in order to minimize the consumption. In the final step, the computed data is presented to the driver through an interactive application. This system was installed on a light electric vehicle (LEV) and by adopting the suggested driving strategy we reduced its consumption by 24.03% with respect to the classic constant-speed control technique.",

In that framework, ontological knowledge representation has become an important tool for the analysis and understanding of multimedia information. Because of the distributed nature of the Semantic Web however, ontologies describing similar fields of knowledge are being developed and the data coming from similar but non-identical ontologies can be combined only if a semantic mapping between them is first established. This has lead to the development of several ontology alignment tools. We propose an automatic ontology alignment method based on the recursive neural network model that uses ontology instances to learn similarities between ontology concepts. Recursive neural networks are an extension of common neural networks, designed to process efficiently structured data. Since \u2026",

Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has appeared in various fields in recent years, including Remote Sensing. Realizing that information extraction tasks for hyperspectral images are burdened by data-specific issues, we identify and address two major problems. Those are the Curse of Dimensionality which occurs due to the high-volume of the data cube and the class imbalance problem which is common in hyperspectral datasets. Dimensionality reduction is an essential preprocessing step to complement a hyperspectral image classification task. Therefore, we propose a feature extraction algorithm for dimensionality reduction, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluations are carried out on the Indian Pines dataset to demonstrate that significant improvements are achieved when using the reduced data in a classification task.",

This is an effort to deal with the uncertainty introduced in the estimation of the transition probabilities and the input probabilities in Markov systems. The asymptotic behaviour of the fuzzy Markov system and its asymptotic variability is considered and given in closed analytic form. Moreover, the asymptotically attainable structures of the system are estimated also in a closed analytic form under some realistic assumptions. The importance of this result lies in the fact that in most cases the traditional methods for estimating the probabilities can not be used due to lack of data and measurement errors.

In this paper, a semantically-aided architecture is proposed for a web-based monitoring system for carotid atherosclerosis that is able to gather and unify heterogeneous data with the use of an ontology and to create a common interface for data access enhancing the interoperability of HIS. The architecture is based on an application ontology of carotid atherosclerosis that is used to (a) integrate heterogeneous data sources on the basis of semantic representation and ontological reasoning and (b) access the critical information using SPARQL query \u2026",

For this reason, most semantic query answering systems prefer to lose some possible correct answers of user queries rather than being irresponsible. Here, we present a method that follows an alternative direction that we call progressive semantic query answering. The idea is to start giving the most relevant correct answers to the user query as soon as possible and continue by giving additional answers with decreasing relevance until you find all the correct answers. We first present a systematic analysis that formalises the notion of answer relevance and that of query answering sequences that we call strides, providing a formal framework for progressive semantic query answering. Then, we describe a practical algorithm performing sound and complete progressive query answering for the W3C\u2019s OWL 2 QL Profile.",

Then, a methodology for solving fuzzy relation equations based on sup-t composition, where t is an Archimedean t-norm, is proposed. This resolution method is simpler and faster than those proposed for covering all the continuous t-norms.

To address this need, we propose the CrowdHeritage open end-to-end enrichment and crowdsourcing ecosystem, which supports an end-to-end workflow for the improvement of cultural heritage metadata by employing crowdsourcing and by combining machine and human intelligence to serve the particular requirements of the cultural heritage domain. The proposed solution repurposes, extends, and combines in an innovative way general-purpose state-of-the-art AI tools, semantic technologies, and aggregation mechanisms with a novel crowdsourcing platform, so as to support seamless enrichment workflows for improving the quality of CH metadata in a scalable, cost-effective, and amusing way.

As a first step in this process, the CultureLabs team has conducted a series of interviews and surveys with the aim to identify and analyse the organisational needs and lessons learnt by different actors from the cultural, social, educational and public administration fields as well as the needs and viewpoints of different migrant communities. These needs have guided the design of an innovative online platform which seeks to offer a number of services for supporting more efficient and participatory governance of cultural heritage on one hand and for enabling inclusive and creative interactions with digital cultural heritage on the other. The CultureLabs platform will allow multiple and diverse stakeholders to discover and combine differ - ent resources and elements of best practices, the \"ingredients\", in order to form new \"recipes\" for social innovation according to their own needs and objectives.",

They provide a source of shared and precisely defined terms, resulting in system interoperability by knowledge sharing and reuse. Unfortunately, the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or overlapping parts. For this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement (aligned). One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class and property names of ontologies using string-distance metrics. Today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature. But all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields, resulting in poor performance when applied in this new domain. In the current paper we present a new string metric for the comparison of names which performs better on the process of ontology alignment as well as \u2026",

In such scenarios a TBox is used to describe the schema of the application while answers to conjunctive queries reflect both the schema and the data. Unfortunately, it is well-known that conjunctive query (CQ) answering over expressive Description Logics (DLs) is of very high computational complexity [7, 5].The need for efficient query answering has motivated the development of (families of) lightweight ontology languages, such as the DL-Lite family [3, 2]. Query answering in these languages is usually performed via a technique called query rewriting. According to this technique, a query and a DL-Lite ontology are transformed into a union of conjunctive queries (often called a UCQ rewriting) such that, the answers of the union of conjunctive queries over the input data and discarding the ontology are precisely the answers of the original query over the data and the ontology.",

This paper presents a novel method for advancing the above classification, by extracting more properties of the analyzed documents. We first extract additional roles from the textual part and together with roles extracted from the ontology statements, we construct an extended document vector representation. We then introduce a pruning algorithm that, for a given document collection, merges concepts of the ontology to produce classes with a sufficient number of corresponding instances. We then classify the documents to ontology classes using the Stanford linear Classifier. Finally, we propose an algorithm that assigns additional concept labels to documents, using the output of the classifier. Our system is evaluated in a set of real data and ontological \u2026",

Although several extensions to expressive DLs have been proposed today and many reasoning algorithms exist there is still no scalable and efficient reasoning system reported, mainly due to inherited computational complexity from crisp DLs and the lack for optimisation techniques for fuzzy DL reasoning algorithms. Following the paradigm of classical DLs, fuzzy extensions to tractable DLs have been proposed. In the current paper we present a fuzzy extension to the tractable DL EL+, creating f-EL+. Besides the syntax and the extended semantics we also provide a reasoning algorithm for f-EL+. Interestingly, our algorithm supports classification over fuzzy subsumption for which scalable reasoning is not known.",

            "Abstract": "Bush encroachment in African savannahs has been identified as a land degradation process, mainly due to the detrimental effect it has on small pastoralist communities. Mapping and monitoring the extent covered by the woody component in savannahs has therefore become the focus of recent remote sensing-based studies. This is mainly due to the large spatial scale that the process of woody vegetation encroachment is related with and the fact that appropriate remote sensing data are now available free of charge. However, due to the nature of savannahs and the mixture of land cover types that commonly make up the signal of a single pixel, simply mapping the presence/absence of woody vegetation is somewhat limiting: it is more important to know whether an area is undergoing an increase in woody cover, ever if it is not the dominant cover type. More recent efforts have, therefore, focused in mapping the fraction of woody vegetation, which, clearly, is much more challenging. This paper proposes a methodological framework for mapping savannah woody vegetation and monitoring its evolution though time, based on very high-resolution data and multi-temporal medium-scale satellite imagery. We tested our approach in a South African savannah region, the Northwest Province (>100,000 km2), 0.5m-pixel aerial photographs for sampling and validation and Landsat data. We first mapped presence/absence of woody vegetation using samples selected over 5x5 km aerial photo subsets acquired between 2009 and 2013 and a Random Forest classifier. We then used these estimates to train a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network to produce \u2026",

For this aim MPEG-7 introduced description schemes representing users\u2019 preferences and tools supporting user interaction. In this paper, using a formal representation of user preferences and a semantic knowledge base, we expand the user profile representation introduced in MPEG-7 in order to acquire more semantic information about the user.

            "Abstract": "Query rewriting is a prominent technique in ontology-based data access (OBDA) applications. Roughly speaking, a rewriting of a query Q wrt an ontology is another query Q'that can be directly evaluated over the data without further reference to the input ontology. In this paper, we observe that many OBDA applications could significantly benefit from precomputing rewritings for certain queries. For example, in query optimisation, materialised rewritings of frequently asked queries can be used to speed up the query reformulation process. Moreover, in systems where users have different levels of access to information, materialised rewritings for the views assigned to each user can be exploited to obtain the set of answers to the input query derivable from the assigned views. Consequently, we investigate the problem of reformulating a query given a set of materialised rewritings and present a practical algorithm \u2026",

In this paper, we first overview weighted fuzzy programs, which bring fuzzy logic programs and connectionist models closer together by associating significance weights with the atoms of a logic rule: by exploiting the existence of weights, it is possible to construct a neural network model that reflects the structure of a weighted fuzzy program. Based on this model, we then introduce the weighted fuzzy program adaptation problem and propose an algorithm for adapting the weights of the rules of the program to fit a given dataset.",

Unfortunately, existing fuzzy reasoners focus on very expressive fuzzy ontology languages, like OWL, and are thus not able to handle the scale of data that the Web provides. For those reasons much research effort has been focused on providing fuzzy extensions and algorithms for tractable ontology languages. In this chapter, the authors present some recent results about reasoning and fuzzy query answering over tractable/polynomial fuzzy ontology languages namely Fuzzy DL-Lite and Fuzzy EL+. Fuzzy DL-Lite provides scalable algorithms for very expressive (extended) conjunctive queries, while Fuzzy EL+ provides polynomial \u2026",

In this paper, we propose a definition of Horn Conjunctive Queries to denote queries that have one negated atom. We also present an algorithm based on query rewriting that finds the answers of a Union of Horn Conjunctive Queries with respect to a set of Existential Rules. Additionally, we conduct some experiments to compare the performance with other state of the art systems that are able to answer conjunctive queries with negation using tableaux algorithms.

Nevertheless, there is the need for modeling adaptation of fuzzy logic programs, so that machine learning techniques, such as connectionist-based learning, can be applied. Weighted fuzzy logic programs bring fuzzy logic programs and connectionist models closer together by associating a significant weight with each atom in the body of a fuzzy rule: by exploiting the existence of the weights, it is possible to construct a connectionist model that reflects the exact structure of a weighted fuzzy logic program. Based on the connectionist representation, we first define the weight adaptation problem as the task of adapting the weights of the rules of a weighted fuzzy logic program, so that they fit best a set of training data, and then we develop a subgradient descent learning \u2026",

The extensive experimental procedure that follows, conducted on two popular datasets, exhibits promising results and constitutes a proof of the robustness of the overall approach.",

            "Abstract": " Query rewriting over lightweight ontologies, like DL-Lite ontologies, is a prominent approach for ontology-based data access. It is often the case in realistic scenarios that users ask an initial query which they later refine, e.g., by extending it with new constraints making their initial request more precise. So far, all DL-Lite systems would need to process the new query from scratch. In this paper, we study the problem of computing the rewriting of an extended query by \u2018extending\u2019 a previously computed rewriting of the initial query and avoiding recomputation. Interestingly, our approach also implies a novel algorithm for computing the rewriting of a fixed query. More precisely, the query can be \u2018decomposed\u2019 into its atoms and then each atom can be processed incrementally. We present detailed algorithms, several optimisations for improving the performance of our query rewriting algorithm, and finally \u2026",

The clusters which are relevant to the termsof the query form the query context. The termsof the clustersthat belong to the context are used to expand the query. Clusters participate in the expansion according to their degree of relevance to the query. Precision of the result is thus improved.

            "Abstract": "Query rewriting is a prominent reasoning technique in ontologybased data access (OBDA) applications. Roughly speaking, a rewriting of a query Q w.r.t. an ontology is another query Q^1 that can be directly evaluated over the data without further reference to the input ontology. In this paper, we observe that many OBDA applications could significantly benefit from precomputing rewritings for certain queries. For example, in query optimisation, materialised rewritings of frequently asked queries can be used to speed up the query reformulation process. Moreover, in systems where users have different levels of access to information, materialised rewritings for the views assigned to each user can be exploited to obtain the set of answers to the input query derivable from the assigned views. Consequently, we investigate the problem of reformulating a query given a set of materialised rewritings and present a practical algorithm. Subsequently, we use our approach to design a fully edged query rewriting algorithm which can exploit materialised rewritings to speed up the rewriting process. Our experimental results confirm the potential of our technique in practice.",

            "Abstract": "Byzantine Iconography Byzantine art refers to the art of Eastern Orthodox states that were concurrent with the Byzantine Empire. Certain artistic traditions born in the Byzantine Empire, particularly regarding icon painting and church architecture, have continued in Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, and other Eastern Orthodox countries up to the present. The icons usually depict sacred figures from the Christian faith, such as Jesus, the Virgin Mary, the apostles, and the saints. At the beginning of the 17th century, iconography manuals represented the most important source of inspiration for icon painters. The 16th-century monk Dionysios from Fourna is credited as the author of the prototypical manual, Interpretation of the Byzantine Art. 2 In it, he defines the rules and iconographic patterns that painters still use to create icons.Byzantine iconography follows a unique convention of painting. The artistic language of Byzantine painters is characterized by apparent simplicity, overemphasized flatness, unreal and symbolic colors, lack of perspective, and strange proportions. The sacred figures are set beyond real time and real space through the use of gold backgrounds. The most important figure in an icon is depicted frontally, focusing on the eyes, facial expression, and hands. Clarity is the rule, not only in describing shapes but also in arranging figures in balanced compositions so that the narrative\u2019s actions are clear. The figures have large eyes, enlarged ears, long, thin noses, and small mouths, each painted following specific rules.",

A key requirement for the architecture of the Semantic Web is to be able to layer \"rules on top of ontologies\" and \"ontologies on top of rules\". This has as a counterpart the definition of a mapping between Description Logics and Logic Programming, which is known as Description Logic Programs. In this paper we extend the Description Logic Programs with fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic in order to be able to represent the imprecision and vagueness of real-life applications. We provide the common semantics of the mapping, and the conditions that must be met for this semantic equivalence, based on the model-theoretic semantics.",

We consider SPARQL instance queries over OWL ontologies and use the OWL 2 Direct Semantics entailment regime of SPARQL for their evaluation. Approximate query answering algorithms are based on the creation of two sets; the set of certain or known query answers and the set of possible query answers, which require checks to determine whether they are real answers. Typically, it is expensive to check the possible answers hence our goal in this paper is to reduce the number of possible answers returned by approximate reasoning algorithms. We present an approach for using schema knowledge from the terminology (TBox) to optimize the evaluation of SPARQL instance queries. We proceed by transforming the query into a set of assertions (ABox). We then show how the TBox and this (small) query ABox can be used to build an equivalent query where the additional query atoms can be used for reducing the set of possible mappings for query variables.",
