We assume a collection of n users, each employing a mixed strategy, which is a probability distribution over links, to control the routing of her own traffic. In a Nash equilibrium, each user selfishly routes her traffic on those links that minimize her expected latency cost, given the network congestion caused by the other users. The social cost of a Nash equilibrium is the expectation, over all random choices of the users, of the maximum, over all links, latency through a link. We embark on a systematic study of several algorithmic problems related to the computation of Nash equilibria for the selfish routing game we consider. In a nutshell, these problems relate to deciding the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium, constructing a \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Dynamic Facility Location problem is a generalization of the classic Facility Location problem, in which the distance metric between clients and facilities changes over time. Such metrics that develop as a function of time are usually called\" evolving metrics\", thus Dynamic Facility Location can be alternatively interpreted as a Facility Location problem in evolving metrics. The objective in this time-dependent variant is to balance the trade-off between optimizing the classic objective function and the stability of the solution, which is modeled by charging a switching cost when a client\u2019s assignment changes from one facility to another. In this paper, we study the online variant of Dynamic Facility Location. We present a randomized O (log m+ log n)-competitive algorithm, where m is the number of facilities and n is the number of clients. In the first step, our algorithm produces a fractional solution, in each timestep, to the objective of Dynamic Facility Location involving a regularization function. This step is an adaptation of the generic algorithm proposed by Buchbinder et al. in their work\" Competitive Analysis via Regularization.\" Then, our algorithm rounds the fractional solution of this timestep to an integral one with the use of exponential clocks. We complement our result by proving a lower bound of \u03a9 (m) for deterministic algorithms and lower bound of \u03a9 (log m) for randomized algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for the online variant of the Dynamic Facility Location problem.",

We consider a general mechanism design setting with m discrete outcomes and n multidimensional agents. We present two randomized truthful mechanisms that extract an O(logm) fraction of the maximum social surplus as residual surplus. The first mechanism achieves an O(logm)-approximation to the social surplus, which is improved to an O(1)-approximation by the second mechanism.

            "Abstract": "The Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in radio networks is the problem of assigning frequencies to transmitters, by exploiting frequency reuse while keeping signal interference to acceptable levels. The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. A Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G (V, E) is an assignment function \u03a6: V\u2192 N such that| \u03a6 (u)-\u03a6 (v)|\u2a7e 2, when u, v are neighbors in G, and| \u03a6 (u)-\u03a6 (v)|\u2a7e 1 when the distance of u, v in G is two. The number of discrete frequencies and the range of frequencies used are called order and span, respectively. The optimization versions of the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) are to minimize the span or the order. In this paper we prove that the radiocoloring problem for general graphs is hard to approximate (unless NP= ZPP) within a factor of n 1/2-\u03b5 (for any \u03b5> 0), where n is the number of vertices of the graph.

We identify a simple and natural sufficient condition for VCGmon to be truthful for general objectives. As a consequence, we obtain that for any cost minimization problem with non-decreasing objective \u00b5, VCGmon is truthful, if the allocation is Maximal-in-Range and \u00b5 is 1-Lipschitz (eg, \u00b5 can be the Lp-norm of the agents\u2019 costs, for any p\u2265 1 or p=\u221e). We apply VCGmon to scheduling on restricted-related machines and obtain a polynomial-time truthful-in-expectation 2-approximate (resp. O (1)-approximate) mechanism for makespan (resp. Lpnorm) minimization. Moreover, applying VCGmon, we obtain polynomial-time truthful O (1)-approximate mechanisms for some fundamental bottleneck network optimization problems with single-parameter agents. On the negative side, we provide strong evidence that VCGmon could not lead to computationally efficient truthful mechanisms with reasonable approximation ratios for binary covering social cost minimization problems. However, we show that VCGmon results in computationally efficient approximately truthful mechanisms for binary covering problems.",

            "Abstract": "The Mallows model, introduced in the seminal paper of Mallows 1957, is one of the most fundamental ranking distribution over the symmetric group . To analyze more complex ranking data, several studies considered the Generalized Mallows model defined by Fligner and Verducci 1986. Despite the significant research interest of ranking distributions, the exact sample complexity of estimating the parameters of a Mallows and a Generalized Mallows Model is not well-understood. The main result of the paper is a tight sample complexity bound for learning Mallows and Generalized Mallows Model. We approach the learning problem by analyzing a more general model which interpolates between the single parameter Mallows Model and the  parameter Mallows model. We call our model Mallows Block Model\u2013referring to the Block Models that are a popular model in theoretical statistics. Our sample complexity analysis gives tight bound for learning the Mallows Block Model for any number of blocks. We provide essentially matching lower bounds for our sample complexity results. As a corollary of our analysis, it turns out that, if the central ranking is known, one single sample from the Mallows Block Model is sufficient to estimate the spread parameters with error that goes to zero as the size of the permutations goes to infinity. In addition, we calculate the exact rate of the parameter estimation error.",

In this paper we extend and generalize their exhaustive sampling approach, presenting a framework for $(1-\\eps)$-approximating any \\kCSP\\ problem in \\emph{sub-exponential} time while significantly relaxing the denseness requirement on the input instance. Specifically, we prove that for any constants  and $\\eps > 0$, we can approximate \\kCSP\\ problems with  constraints within a factor of $(1-\\eps)$ in time $2^{O(n^{1-\\delta}\\ln n /\\eps^3)}$. The framework is quite general and includes classical optimization problems, such as \\MC, {\\sc Max}-DICUT, \\kSAT, and (with a slight extension) -{\\sc Densest Subgraph}, as special cases. For \\MC\\ in particular (where ), it gives an approximation scheme that runs in time sub-exponential in  even for \"almost-sparse\" instances (graphs with  edges). We prove that our results are essentially best possible, assuming the ETH. First, the density requirement cannot be relaxed further: there exists a constant  such that for all , \\kSAT\\ instances with  clauses cannot be approximated within a ratio better than  in time . Second, the running time of our algorithm is almost tight \\emph{for all densities}.

            "Abstract": "We investigate the effectiveness of Stackelberg strategies for atomic congestion games with unsplittable demands. In our setting, only a fraction of the players are selfish, while the rest are willing to follow a predetermined strategy. A Stackelberg strategy assigns the coordinated players to appropriately selected strategies trying to minimize the performance degradation due to the selfish players. We consider two orthogonal cases, namely congestion games with affine latency functions and arbitrary strategies, and congestion games on parallel links with arbitrary non-decreasing latency functions. We restrict our attention to pure Nash equilibria and derive strong upper and lower bounds on the pure Price of Anarchy (PoA) under different Stackelberg strategies.For affine congestion games, we consider the Stackelberg strategies LLF and Scale introduced by Roughgarden (SIAM J.

            "Abstract": "We consider the problem of learning the true ordering of a set of alternatives from largely incomplete and noisy rankings. We introduce a natural generalization of both the Mallows model, a popular model of ranking distributions, and the extensively studied model of ranking from pairwise comparisons. Our selective Mallows model outputs a noisy ranking on any given subset of alternatives, based on an underlying Mallows distribution. Assuming a sequence of subsets where each pair of alternatives appears frequently enough, we obtain strong asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning the underlying complete central ranking and the (identities and the) ranking of the top k alternatives from selective Mallows rankings. Moreover, building on the work of (Braverman and Mossel, 2009), we show how to efficiently compute the maximum likelihood complete ranking from selective Mallows rankings.",

Such a paradox is a pervasive phenomenon in real-world networks. Any administrator who wants to improve equilibrium delays in selfish networks, is facing some basic questions:\u2013Is the network paradox-ridden?\u2013How can we delete some edges to optimize equilibrium flow delays?\u2013How can we modify edge latencies to optimize equilibrium flow delays? Unfortunately, such questions lead to NP-hard problems in general. In this work, we impose some natural restrictions on our networks, eg we assume strictly increasing linear latencies. Our target is to formulate efficient algorithms for the three questions above. We manage to provide:\u2013A polynomial-time algorithm that decides if a network is paradox-ridden, when latencies are linear and strictly increasing.\u2013A reduction of the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "For many learning problems one may not have access to fine grained label information; eg, an image can be labeled as husky, dog, or even animal depending on the expertise of the annotator. In this work, we formalize these settings and study the problem of learning from such coarse data. Instead of observing the actual labels from a set , we observe coarse labels corresponding to a partition of (or a mixture of partitions). Our main algorithmic result is that essentially any problem learnable from fine grained labels can also be learned efficiently when the coarse data are sufficiently informative. We obtain our result through a generic reduction for answering Statistical Queries (SQ) over fine grained labels given only coarse labels. The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially on the information distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels . We also investigate the case of (infinitely many) real valued labels focusing on a central problem in censored and truncated statistics: Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data. We provide an efficient algorithm when the sets in the partition are convex and establish that the problem is NP-hard even for very simple non-convex sets.",

In the incremental variant, the algorithm can also merge existing facilities (and the corresponding demand clusters) with each other, and only the decision of assigning some demands to the same facility is irrevocable. The goal is to maintain, either online or incrementally, a set of facilities and an assignment of the demands to them that minimize the total facility opening cost plus the assignment cost for all demands.In this survey, we discuss the previous work on online and incremental algorithms for Facility Location.

For example, there exist potentials proving the existence of Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in the (even unrelated) parallel links setting; the Finite Improvement Property collapses as soon as we depart from linear delays, but there is an exact potential (and thus PNE) for the case of linear delays, in the network setting; the Price of Anarchy on identical parallel links demonstrates a quite surprising threshold behavior: it persists on being asymptotically equal to that in the case of the non\u2013cooperative KP\u2013model, unless \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Along with high penetration of Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations are required to service a large amount of charging requests while accounting for constraints on the station's peak electricity consumption. To this end, a charging station needs to make online charging scheduling decisions often under limited future information. An important challenge relates to the prioritization of EVs that have unknown valuations for different levels of charging services. In this paper, we take into consideration the inability of EV users to express these valuations explicitly. We consider a paradigm where a menu of possible charging schedules and corresponding prices is generated online. By letting the EV users pick their most preferable menu option, the proposed algorithm commits on each EV's charging completion time upon its arrival, achieves a near optimal total weighted charging completion time, and prevents the users \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in radio networks is the problem of assigning frequencies to transmitters exploiting frequency reuse while keeping signal interference to acceptable levels. The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. The Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G (V, E) is an assignment function \u039b: V\u2192 IN such that| \u039b (u)\u2212 \u039b (v)|\u2265 2, when u, v are neighbors in G, and| \u039b (u)\u2212 \u039b (v)|\u2265 1 when the distance of u, v in G is two. The discrete number of frequencies used is called order and the range of frequencies used, span. The optimization versions of the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) are to minimize the span (min span RCP) or the order (min order RCP). Here, we consider the optimization version of RCP where one tries to minimize the order of the assignment.In this paper, we deal with an interesting variation of the radiocoloring problem: that of satisfying frequency \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Congestion games ignore the stochastic nature of resource delays and the risk-averse attitude of the players to uncertainty. To take these aspects into account, we introduce two variants of atomic congestion games, one with stochastic players, where each player assigns load to her strategy independently with a given probability, and another with stochastic edges, where the latency functions are random. In both variants, the players are risk-averse, and their individual cost is a player-specific quantile of their delay distribution. We focus on parallel-link networks and investigate how the main properties of such games depend on the risk attitude and on the participation probabilities of the players. In a nutshell, we prove that stochastic congestion games on parallel-links admit an efficiently computable pure Nash equilibrium if the players have either the same risk attitude or the same participation probabilities \u2026",

In Online Facility Location (OFL), demands arrive one-by-one in a metric space and must be (irrevocably) assigned to an open facility upon arrival, without any knowledge about future demands. We present an online algorithm for OFL that exploits potentially imperfect predictions on the locations of the optimal facilities. We prove that the competitive ratio decreases smoothly from sublogarithmic in the number of demands to constant, as the error, i.e., the total distance of the predicted locations to the optimal facility locations, decreases towards zero. We complement our analysis with a matching lower bound establishing that the dependence of the algorithm's competitive ratio on the error is optimal, up to constant factors. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on real world data and compare our learning augmented approach with the current best online algorithm for the problem.",

Our model takes into account both positive and negative correlations between any pair of advertisers, so that the click-through rate of an ad depends on the identity, relative order and distance of other ads appearing in the advertisements list. In the proposed model we present several computational results concerning the Winner Determination problem for Social Welfare maximization. These include hardness of approximation and polynomial time exact and approximation algorithms. We conclude with an evaluation of the Generalized Second Price mechanism in presence of externalities.",

More specifically, we investigate how we can efficiently estimate the number of small subgraphs (eg, edges, triangles, etc.) based on full access to one or two noisy and incomplete samples of a large underlying network and on few queries revealing the neighborhood of carefully selected vertices. After specifying a random generator which removes edges from the underlying graph, we present estimators with strong provable performance guarantees, which exploit information from the noisy network samples and query a constant number of the most important vertices for the estimation. Our experimental evaluation shows that, in practice, a single noisy network sample and a couple of hundreds neighborhood queries suffice for accurately estimating the number of triangles in networks with millions of vertices and edges.",

In this setting, jobs are required to be executed non-preemptively and in unison, in the sense that they occupy, during their execution, the same time interval over all the machines of the allocated set. In this work, we study generalizations of malleable job scheduling inspired by standard scheduling on unrelated machines. Specifically, we introduce a general model of malleable job scheduling, where each machine has a (possibly different) speed for each job, and the processing time of a job  on a set of allocated machines  depends on the total speed of  with respect to . For machines with unrelated speeds, we show that the optimal makespan cannot be approximated within a factor less than , unless . On the positive side, we present polynomial-time algorithms with approximation ratios  for machines with unrelated speeds,  for machines with uniform speeds, and  for restricted assignments on identical machines. Our algorithms are based on deterministic LP rounding. They result in sparse schedules, in the sense that each machine shares at most one job with other machines. We also prove lower bounds on the integrality gap of  for unrelated speeds ( is the golden ratio) and  for uniform speeds and restricted assignments. To indicate the generality of our approach, we show that it also yields constant factor approximation algorithms for a variant where we determine the effective speed of a set of allocated machines based on the  norm of their speeds.",

In many domains, expressed opinions of people are not only affected by local interaction and personal beliefs, but also by influences that stem from global properties of the opinions present in the society. To capture the interplay of such global and local effects, we propose a model of opinion formation games with aggregation, where we concentrate on the average public opinion as a natural way to represent a global trend in the society. While the average alone does not have good strategic properties as an aggregation rule, we show that with a limited influence of the average public opinion, the good properties of opinion formation models are preserved. More formally, we show that a unique equilibrium exists in average-oriented opinion formation games. Simultaneous best-response dynamics converge to within \u2026",

Next, we consider the problem of computing a minimum weight subset of temporal edges that preserve connectivity of a given temporal graph either from a given vertex r (r-MTC problem) or among all vertex pairs (MTC problem). We show that the approximability of r-MTC is closely related to the approximability of Directed Steiner Tree and that r-MTC can be solved in polynomial time if the underlying graph has bounded treewidth. We also show that the best approximation ratio for MTC is at least  and at most , for any constant , where  is the number of temporal edges and  is the maximum degree of the underlying graph. Furthermore, we prove that the unweighted version of MTC is APX-hard and that MTC is efficiently solvable in trees and -approximable in cycles.",

We assume a collection of n users, each employing a mixed strategy, which is a probability distribution over links, to control the routing of its own assigned traffic. In a Nash equilibrium, each user selfishly routes its traffic on those links that minimize its expected latency cost, given the network congestion caused by the other users. The social cost of a Nash equilibrium is the expectation, over all random choices of the users, of the maximum, over all links, latency through a link.We embark on a systematic study of several algorithmic problems related to the computation of Nash equilibria for the selfish routing game we consider.

Specifically, we first turn our attention to single-parameter domains in auctions, namely single item and multi-unit auctions. For the former case, we show that the Vickrey auction can be implemented with an expected communication complexity of at  bits per bidder, for any , assuming that the valuations can be represented with a constant number of bits. As a corollary, we provide a compelling method to increment the price in English auctions. By employing an efficient encoding scheme, we show that the same bound can be obtained for multi-item auctions with additive bidders and a constant number of items, and for multi-unit auctions with unit demand bidders. Moreover, we apply our framework to games without monetary transfers \u2026",

The classes are directed towards personnel in various areas and aim at the retraining and update of the personnel in subjects of special interest in their line of work. The conduction of classes takes place, from and towards, remote regions with the aid of a computer network. Hippocrates is a flexible and easy-to-use application, which permits students, who sit in front of remotely situated workstations, to attend classes or seminars given by a teacher or expert, who can also be located in some remote geographical area. Hippocrates can be thought of as a distributed transparency projector. The teacher can project transparencies on the screens of the students\u2019 workstations and can emphasize or indicate regions of interest on them by using the graphical tools offered by Hippocrates. Immediate results of the use of Hippocrates are the fast updating of the personnel in remote areas and the upgrading of the quality of the services they offer.",

To this end, we adopt the model of graphical linear congestion games with weighted players, where the individual cost and the strategy selection of each player only depends on his neighboring players in the social graph. We show that such games admit a potential function, and thus a PNE. Our main result is that the impact of social ignorance on the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) is naturally quantified by the independence number \u03b1(G) of the social graph G. In particular, we show that the PoA grows roughly as \u03b1(G)(\u03b1(G)\u2009+\u20092), which is essentially tight as long as \u03b1(G) does not exceed half the number of players, and that \u2026",

Each agent seeks to minimize her distance to the nearest facility. We are interested in (deterministic or randomized) strategyproof mechanisms without payments that achieve a reasonable approximation ratio to the optimal social cost of the agents. To circumvent the inapproximability of -Facility Location by deterministic strategyproof mechanisms, we restrict our attention to perturbation stable instances. An instance of -Facility Location on the line is -perturbation stable (or simply, -stable), for some , if the optimal agent clustering is not affected by moving any subset of consecutive agent locations closer to each other by a factor at most . We show that the optimal solution is strategyproof in -stable instances whose optimal solution does not include any singleton clusters, and that allocating the facility to the agent next to the rightmost one in each optimal cluster (or to the unique agent, for singleton clusters) is strategyproof and -approximate for -stable instances (even if their optimal solution includes singleton clusters). On the negative side, we show that for any  and any , there is no deterministic anonymous mechanism that achieves a bounded approximation ratio and is strategyproof in -stable instances. We also prove that allocating the facility to a random agent of each optimal cluster is strategyproof and -approximate in -stable instances.

            "Abstract": "We consider the online Min-Sum Set Cover (MSSC), a natural and intriguing generalization of the classical list update problem. In Online MSSC, the algorithm maintains a permutation on  elements based on subsets  arriving online. The algorithm serves each set  upon arrival, using its current permutation , incurring an access cost equal to the position of the first element of  in . Then, the algorithm may update its permutation to , incurring a moving cost equal to the Kendall tau distance of  to . The objective is to minimize the total access and moving cost for serving the entire sequence. We consider the -uniform version, where each  has cardinality . List update is the special case where . We obtain tight bounds on the competitive ratio of deterministic online algorithms for MSSC against a static adversary, that serves the entire sequence by a single permutation. First, we show a lower bound of  on the competitive ratio. Then, we consider several natural generalizations of successful list update algorithms and show that they fail to achieve any interesting competitive guarantee. On the positive side, we obtain a -competitive deterministic algorithm using ideas from online learning and the multiplicative weight updates (MWU) algorithm. Furthermore, we consider efficient algorithms. We propose a memoryless online algorithm, called Move-All-Equally, which is inspired by the Double Coverage algorithm for the -server problem.

            "Abstract": "Label Ranking (LR) corresponds to the problem of learning a hypothesis that maps features to rankings over a finite set of labels. We adopt a nonparametric regression approach to LR and obtain theoretical performance guarantees for this fundamental practical problem. We introduce a generative model for Label Ranking, in noiseless and noisy nonparametric regression settings, and provide sample complexity bounds for learning algorithms in both cases. In the noiseless setting, we study the LR problem with full rankings and provide computationally efficient algorithms using decision trees and random forests in the high-dimensional regime. In the noisy setting, we consider the more general cases of LR with incomplete and partial rankings from a statistical viewpoint and obtain sample complexity bounds using the One-Versus-One approach of multiclass classification. Finally, we complement our theoretical contributions with experiments, aiming to understand how the input regression noise affects the observed output.",

We focus on the closely related problems of k-Facility Location and Facility Location with a uniform facility opening cost, instead of a bound of k on the number of facilities.

Diakonikolas, Kane and Stewart [COLT'16] showed a lower bound of  samples to learn the 's within error . The question whether sampling from powers of PBDs can reduce this sampling complexity, has a negative answer since we show that the exponential number of samples is inevitable. Having sampling access to the powers of a PBD we then give a nearly optimal algorithm that learns its 's. To prove our two last lower bounds we extend the classical minimax risk definition from statistics to \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We exploit the core-periphery structure and the strong homophilic properties of online social networks to develop faster and more accurate algorithms for user interest prediction. The core of modern social networks consists of relatively few influential users, whose interest profiles are publicly available, while the majority of peripheral users follow enough of them based on common interests. Our approach is to predict the interests of the peripheral nodes starting from the interests of their influential connections. To this end, we need a formal model that explains how common interests lead to network connections. Thus, we propose a stochastic interest formation model, the Nearest Neighbor Influence Model (NNIM), which is inspired by the Hegselmann-Krause opinion formation model and aims to explain how homophily shapes the network. Based on NNIM, we develop an efficient approach for predicting the interests of the peripheral users. At the technical level, we use Variational Expectation-Maximization to optimize the instantaneous likelihood function using a mean-field approximation of NNIM. We prove that our algorithm converges fast and is capable of scaling smoothly to networks with millions of nodes. Our experiments on standard network benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than the best known node embedding methods and achieves similar accuracy.",

The issue of designing optimal tax vectors for selfish routing games has been studied extensively in the literature. We study for the first time taxation for networks with atomic users which have unsplittable traffic demands and are heterogeneous, i.e., have different sensitivities to taxes. On the positive side, we show the existence of weakly-optimal taxes for single-source network games. On the negative side, we show that the cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous users differ sharply as far as the existence of strongly-optimal taxes is concerned: there are parallel-link \u2026",

We show that computing a PNE of linear weighted congestion games is PLS-complete either for very restricted strategy spaces, namely when player strategies are paths on a series-parallel network with a single origin and destination, or for very restricted latency functions, namely when the latency on each resource is equal to the congestion. Our results reveal a remarkable gap regarding the complexity of PNE in congestion games with weighted and unweighted players, since in case of unweighted players, a PNE can be easily computed by either a simple greedy algorithm (for series-parallel networks) or any better response dynamics (when the latency is equal to the congestion). For the latter of the results above, we need to show first that computing a local optimum of a natural restriction of Max-Cut, which we call Node-Max-Cut, is PLS-complete. In Node-Max-Cut, the input graph is vertex-weighted and the weight of each edge is equal to the product of the weights of its endpoints. Due to the very restricted nature of Node-Max-Cut, the reduction requires a careful combination of new gadgets with ideas and techniques from previous work. We also show how to compute efficiently a (1+ \u03b5)-approximate equilibrium for Node-Max-Cut, if the number of different vertex weights is constant.",

This is the first time that the computational and statistical complexity of learning from truncated samples is considered in a discrete setting. We introduce a natural notion of\\emph {fatness} of the truncation set , under which truncated samples reveal enough information about the true distribution. We show that if the truncation set is sufficiently fat, samples from the true distribution can be generated from truncated samples. A stunning consequence is that virtually any statistical task (eg, learning in total variation distance, parameter estimation, uniformity or identity testing) that can be performed efficiently for Boolean product distributions, can also be performed from truncated samples, with a small increase in sample complexity. We generalize our approach to ranking distributions over  alternatives, where we show how fatness implies efficient parameter estimation of Mallows models from truncated samples. Exploring the limits of learning discrete models from truncated samples, we identify three natural conditions that are necessary for efficient identifiability:(i) the truncation set  should be rich enough;(ii)  should be accessible through membership queries; and (iii) the truncation by  should leave enough randomness in all directions. By carefully adapting the Stochastic Gradient Descent approach of (Daskalakis et al., FOCS 2018), we show that these conditions are also sufficient for efficient learning of truncated Boolean product distributions.",

We consider the task of generating a large collection of random nodes in the network assuming limited query access (where querying a node reveals its set of neighbors). In current approaches, based on long random walks, the number of queries per sample scales linearly with the mixing time of the network, which can be prohibitive for large real-world networks. We propose a new method for sampling multiple nodes that bypasses the dependence in the mixing time by explicitly searching for less accessible components in the network. We test our approach on a variety of real-world and synthetic networks with up to tens of millions of nodes, demonstrating a query complexity improvement of up to  compared to the state of the art.",

            "Abstract": "In this work, we seek a more refined understanding of the complexity of local optimum computation for Max-Cut and pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) computation for congestion games with weighted players and linear latency functions. We show that computing a PNE of linear weighted congestion games is PLS-complete either for very restricted strategy spaces, namely when player strategies are paths on a series-parallel network with a single origin and destination, or for very restricted latency functions, namely when the latency on each resource is equal to the congestion. Our results reveal a remarkable gap regarding the complexity of PNE in congestion games with weighted and unweighted players, since in case of unweighted players, a PNE can be easily computed by either a simple greedy algorithm (for series-parallel networks) or any better response dynamics (when the latency is equal to the congestion). For the latter of the results above, we need to show first that computing a local optimum of a natural restriction of Max-Cut, which we call \\emph{Node-Max-Cut}, is PLS-complete. In Node-Max-Cut, the input graph is vertex-weighted and the weight of each edge is equal to the product of the weights of its endpoints. Due to the very restricted nature of Node-Max-Cut, the reduction requires a careful combination of new gadgets with ideas and techniques from previous work. We also show how to compute efficiently a $(1+\\eps)$-approximate equilibrium for Node-Max-Cut, if the number of different vertex weights is constant.",

First, if  represents the doubling dimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is , where  represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics this implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general metrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by Skowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first nexus between the performance of any voting rule and the \"intrinsic dimensionality\" of the underlying metric space. We also establish a nearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind. Moreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural learning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes. Specifically, we introduce simple, deterministic and decentralized exploration/exploitation dynamics, and we show that they converge to a candidate with  distortion. Finally, driven by applications in facility location games, we consider several refinements and extensions of the standard metric-setting. Namely, we prove that the deterministic mechanism recently introduced by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah (FOCS '20) attains the optimal distortion bound of  under ultra-metrics, while it also comes close to our lower bound under distances satisfying approximate triangle inequalities.",

Our goal is to reconstruct such signals from scarce and/or unreliable measurements. We achieve that by leveraging a learned structural prior in the form of a Deep Generative Network. Similar methods have been tested almost exclusively for images which display useful properties (e.g., locality, periodicity) that are implicitly exploited. However, SEDs lack such properties which make the problem more challenging. We manage to successfully extend the methods to SEDs using a Generative Latent Optimization model trained with significantly fewer and corrupted data.",

            "Abstract": "In routing games, the selfish behavior of the players may lead to a degradation of the network performance at equilibrium. In more than a few cases however, the equilibrium performance can be significantly improved if we remove some edges from the network. This counterintuitive fact, widely known as Braess\u02bcs paradox, gives rise to the (selfish) network design problem, where we seek to recognize routing games suffering from the paradox, and to improve their equilibrium performance by edge removal. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity and the approximability of the network design problem for non-atomic bottleneck routing games, where the individual cost of each player is the bottleneck cost of her path, and the social cost is the bottleneck cost of the network, ie the maximum latency of a used edge. We first show that bottleneck routing games do not suffer from Braess\u02bcs paradox either if \u2026",

CPD asks for the selection of kq items and their assignment to k disjoint sets of size q each.

Without prior knowledge of , the learner maintains a ranking  aiming that at least  items from  appear high in . This is a fundamental problem in preference aggregation with applications to, e.g., ordering product or news items in web pages based on user scrolling and click patterns. The widely studied Generalized Min-Sum-Set-Cover (GMSSC) problem serves as a formal model for the setting above. GMSSC is NP-hard and the standard application of no-regret online learning algorithms is computationally inefficient, because they operate in the space of rankings. In this work, we show how to achieve low regret for GMSSC in polynomial-time. We employ dimensionality reduction from rankings to the space of doubly stochastic matrices, where we apply Online Gradient Descent. A key step is to show how subgradients can be computed efficiently, by solving the dual of a configuration LP. Using oblivious deterministic and randomized rounding schemes, we map doubly stochastic matrices back to rankings with a small loss in the GMSSC objective.",

We adopt the simple model of \u03b3-modifiable routing games, a variant of selfish routing games with restricted tolls. We prove that computing the best \u03b3-enforceable flow is NP-hard for parallel-link networks with affine latencies and two classes of heterogeneous risk-averse players.

It is known that truthful greedy-like mechanisms for CAs with multi-minded bidders do not achieve good approximation guarantees.In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of greedy mechanism design and investigate under which general assumptions, we can have efficient and truthful greedy mechanisms for CAs. Towards this goal, we use the framework of priority algorithms and weak and strong verification, where the bidders are not allowed to overbid on their winning set or on any subset of this set, respectively. We provide a complete characterization of the power of weak verification showing that it is sufficient and necessary for any greedy fixed priority algorithm to become truthful with the use of money or not, depending on the ordering of the bids. Moreover, we show that strong verification is sufficient and necessary to obtain a 2-approximate truthful mechanism with money, based on a known greedy algorithm, for the problem of submodular CAs in finite bidding domains. Our proof is based on an interesting structural analysis of the strongly connected components of the declaration graph.",

            "Abstract": "Hierarchical specifications of graphs have been widely used in many important applications, such as VLSI design, parallel programming and software engineering. A well known hierarchical specification model, considered in this work, is that of Lengauer [9, 10] referred to as L-specifications. In this paper we discuss a restriction on the L-specifications resulting to graphs which we call Well-Separated (WS). This class is characterized by a polynomial time (to the size of the specification of the graph) testable combinatorial property.        In this work we study the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) on WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. The optimization version of RCP studied here, consists in assigning colors to the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of distance at most two get different colors. The objective here is to minimize the number of colors used. This problem is equivalent to the problem of vertex coloring the square of a graph G, G           2, where G           2 has the same vertex set as G and there is an edge between any two vertices of G           2 if their distance in G is at most 2.        We first show that RCP is       -complete for WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. Second, we present a polynomial time 3-approximation algorithm as well as a more efficient 4-approximation algorithm for RCP on graphs of this class.        We note that, the best currently known approximation ratio for the RCP on ordinary (non-hierarchical) planar graphs of general degree is 2 ([6, 1]). Note also that the only known results on any kind of coloring problems have been shown for another special kind of hierarchical graphs (unit disk graphs \u2026",

We present experimental results using 7 experimental datasets and compare them with those derived from other existing algorithms (such as Mcode, HCS, RNSC and SideS), to demonstrate the efficiency of the AHC regarding successful prediction ratio of protein \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We study dynamic clustering problems from the perspective of online learning. We consider an online learning problem, called \\textit{Dynamic -Clustering}, in which  centers are maintained in a metric space over time (centers may change positions) such as a dynamically changing set of  clients is served in the best possible way. The connection cost at round  is given by the \\textit{-norm} of the vector consisting of the distance of each client to its closest center at round , for some  or . We present a \\textit{-regret} polynomial-time online learning algorithm and show that, under some well-established computational complexity conjectures, \\textit{constant-regret} cannot be achieved in polynomial-time. In addition to the efficient solution of Dynamic -Clustering, our work contributes to the long line of research on combinatorial online learning.",

            "Abstract": "We investigate how and to which extent one can exploit risk-aversion and modify the perceived cost of the players in selfish routing so that the Price of Anarchy () is improved. We introduce small random perturbations to the edge latencies so that the expected latency does not change, but the perceived cost of the players increases due to risk-aversion. We adopt the model of -modifiable routing games, a variant of routing games with restricted tolls. We prove that computing the best -enforceable flow is -hard for parallel-link networks with affine latencies and two classes of heterogeneous risk-averse players. On the positive side, we show that for parallel-link networks with heterogeneous players and for series-parallel networks with homogeneous players, there exists a nicely structured -enforceable flow whose  improves fast as  increases. We show that the complexity of computing such a -enforceable flow \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We study here the effect of concurrent greedy moves of players in atomic congestion games where n selfish agents (players) wish to select a resource each (out of m resources) so that her selfish delay there is not much. The problem of \u201cmaintaining\u201d global progress while allowing concurrent play is exactly what is examined and answered here. We examine two orthogonal settings : (i) A game where the players decide their moves without global information, each acting \u201cfreely\u201d by sampling resources randomly and locally deciding to migrate (if the new resource is better) via a random experiment. Here, the resources can have quite arbitrary latency that is load dependent. (ii) An \u201corganised\u201d setting where the players are pre-partitioned into selfish groups (coalitions) and where each coalition does an improving coalitional move. Our work considers concurrent selfish play for arbitrary latencies for the first time \u2026",
