Key characteristics of this new genre are introduced first, followed by a design framework and a set of design guidelines. Examples of location-based games will be presented and typical design patterns as extracted from previous workshops will be discussed. This course has already been run in the frame of several conferences and summer schools (Sintoris 2015). Typical course participants include interaction designers, game designers and developers, practitioners and researchers interested in location-based games. The course is presented by researchers who have been involved in designing and studying human interaction with location-based games for many years. Examples of games developed by the course organizers include MuseumScrabble, RebelsVsSpies \u2026",

Such knowledge denotes the added value of personalizing graphical password schemes towards the unique cognitive characteristics of the users. However, real-time and accurate cognition-based predictive user models are necessary to reach such a breakthrough. In this paper, we present the results of such an attempt, where an in-lab eye-tracking study was conducted with 36 participants who completed a recall-based graphical password composition task. We adopted a credible cognitive style theory, and investigated a variety of eye-tracking metrics to predict participants' cognitive styles. Results' analysis reveals that inferring individual cognitive differences in real-time during graphical password composition is feasible within a few seconds and that specific eye-tracking metrics \u2026",

One shared space used for jointly producing a diagrammatic representation (concept map or other form of diagram), and one for text based communication. The group activities have a time span of typical classes: i.e. a few minutes to a few hours. In this context, we focus on the study of typical teacher actions and used representations and on the support that the tools used provided to the teacher for supervision of the class and group activities.",

These are Synergo and ActivityLens. Synergo constitutes a synchronous collaboration support environment that provides integrated tools for analysis of interaction. A large corpus concerning online human interactions is generated and further analysed using Synergo. ActivityLens constitutes an environment that aids analysis of collaborative learning activities using multiple sources of data such as sequential logs, video captures and documents related to the activity, a corpus of oral interactions can be analysed using this tool, and for this reason is considered relevant to generation and analysis of online human interactions. In following, a presentation of the Synergo environment is included accompanied by a study on the use of the tool. Next, ActivityLens as an analysis tool that extends the analysis facilities of Synergo is included, focusing on the manipulation of various sources of analysis data and on the support for qualitative methodological studies. In the third part the context of current use of the two tools is described, mentioning cases of research groups that have used the tools. Finally, this document ends with a discussion on standards on representation of interaction data and the related emergent need to develop widely adopted descriptions of corpora of interaction analysis data and the potential benefits of that approach to the research community in the future, based on some concrete examples from the experience of the Unvierstity of \u2026",

In this paper we study techniques for determining the state of an evolving collaborative process, while the activity is in progress, making the users aware of this state. For this reason, a State of Collaboration (SoC) indicator has been defined, which is calculated using a combination of machine-learning and statistical techniques. Subse-quently a study was performed during which SoC was presented to a number of groups of collaborating partners engaged in problem-solving activities. It was found that this group awareness mechanism influenced in a significant way the behavior of the groups in which it was used. This study has wider implications to the design of groupware and in particular towards gaining an insight into the effect of group awareness mechanisms on computer-mediated \u2026",

This metaphor suggests that users assess the profitability of following a particular hyperlink based on its perceived semantic association with their goal. The purpose of this paper is to study how information scent, this important attribute of hypermedia navigability, influences concurrently four aspects of users' behaviour while exploring a website: (1) distribution of attention; (2) confidence in choice of link; (3) efficiency; and (4) effectiveness. It was found that in webpages with high scent, users were significantly more focused, confident of their choices, efficient and effective compared to webpages with ambiguous scent. The findings of the study are discussed in comparison with results obtained from a previously conducted analysis using InfoScent \u2026",

To address this issue, supervised classification models have been studied and developed in order to assist course facilitators in detecting forum discussions that seek for their intervention. A key issue studied by the literature refers to the transferability of these models to domains other than the domain in which they were initially trained. Typically these models employ domain-dependent features, and therefore they fail to transfer to other subject matters. In this study, we propose and evaluate an alternative way of building supervised models in this context, by using the semantic similarities of the forum transcripts with the dynamically created corpora from the MOOC environment as training features. Specifically, in this study, we analyze the case of two MOOCs, in which the models \u2026",

Open card sorting is a widely-used method to create information architectures based on users' groupings of the content. However, little is known about the method's cross-study reliability: Does it produce consistent content groupings for similar profile participants involved in different card sort studies? This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the method's cross-study reliability. Six card sorts involving 140 participants were conducted: three open sorts for a travel website, and three for an eshop. Results showed that participants provided highly similar card sorting data for the same content. A rather high agreement of the produced navigation schemes was also found. These findings provide support for the cross-study reliability of the open card sorting method.",

It can be applied to recordings (video, audio, screen recordings, or log data) of student interaction and does not necessarily require transcripts or written records. While the rating scheme was originally developed in the context of a specific CSCL setting (video-based interdisciplinary problem-solving in the medical domain; Meier et al.

            "Abstract": "Machine Learning techniques have been extensively used in Power Systems Analysis during the last years. A Machine Learning Toolkit, ie a versatile software environment incorporating multiple interoperable tools facilitating experimentation, can be a valuable asset during power systems analysis studies. In this paper our experience with building such a Toolkit, incorporating a repository of data (Data Warehouse), is described. A number of machine learning and analysis tools have been built and applied on collected structured data in order to perform steady state security assessment of a power system. The Toolkit (UMLPSE), the data collection process, the analysis performed and the tools used are the subject of this paper. In particular application of the developed toolkit in contingency analysis is demonstrated. A series of system indices and metrics are stored in the data warehouse describing the effects each contingency is expected to have on each operating point. The system indices and metrics are subsequently filtered through statistical procedures with qualitative measures and criteria to be used as training data for machine learning tools (neural networks and decision trees). The performance indices and the fine tuning of the parameters of these machine learning tools are then considered for the screening and ranking of the contingencies for any given electrical network operating point. It is argued that the proposed approach and tools can be applied to many similar power systems analysis studies.",

These problems include mostly the limited bandwidth of networks especially of dialup connections, but also the presence of firewalls and proxy servers in intranets that inhibit peer-to-peer communication. A flexible architecture needs to be defined that overcomes these problems and permits a smooth collaborative environment that would satisfy the needs of end users.

First, the individuals' gaze patterns, represented by the unique fixations on each area of interest (AOI) and the total fixation duration per AOI, are calculated. Second, the gaze-based entropy of the individual is calculated. To investigate whether the proposed metric is a credible predictor of the password strength, we conducted two feasibility studies. Results revealed a strong positive correlation between the strength of the created passwords and the gaze-based entropy. Hence, we argue that the proposed gaze-based metric allows for unobtrusive prediction of the strength of the password a user is going to create and enables intervention to the password composition for helping users create stronger passwords.",

These games are played in physical space, but at the same time, they are supported by actions and events in an interconnected virtual space. Learning in these games is related to issues like the narrative structure, space and game rules and content that define the virtual game space. First, we introduce the theoretical and empirical considerations of mobile location based games, and then we discuss an analytical framework of their main characteristics through typical examples. In particular, we focus on their narrative structure, the interaction modes that they afford, their use of physical space as prop for action, the way this is linked to virtual space and the possible learning impact the game activities have. Finally we conclude with an outline of future trends and possibilities that these kinds of playful activities can have on learning, especially outside \u2026",

To support this argument we studied the collaborative practice of 228 dyads based on graphs. The properties of each graph were evaluated in comparison to ratings of collaboration quality as assessed by human experts. The activities were also examined with respect to the solution quality.

Nonroutine tasks are characterised by exponential growth of expected task structures. Ways of tackling the complexity of this task structure is the objective of the described approach. The proposed development life cycle involves model-driven requirement speci\ufb01cations, design and implementation phase, followed by a \ufb01eld study evaluation phase. During the latter phase, evaluation of the effectiveness of the system in supporting the expected typical tasks is measured, and new requirements are derived that modify the original design. This spiral design process is supported by appropriate tools. Such tools typically allow expression of the designer expectations concerning user cognitive tasks. During \ufb01eld studies, the tools then support tracking of user interaction and inferring cognitive task models, which are matched against the original designer\u2019s assumption on the user cognitive models.In this chapter, a survey of applications of cognitive modelling techniques in the design of systems involving nonroutine tasks is offered. Subsequently, an outline of a proposed design and evaluation framework and the related tools are described. Existing cognitive task modelling techniques such as hierarchical task analysis have been adapted, in the frame of the reported framework, to be used effectively for expression of both the designer model and the user task model concerning observed interaction.

Interaction analysis is central in the study of CSCL activities, since in such activities through interactions between partners the state of evolving group knowledge is communicated. This interaction is facilitated by tools that allow logging of events that take place, capturing thus information about the content and the process of collaboration. Automated analysis techniques of this information can be developed. The objective of this analysis is often to support participants, in several ways: explicitly, by providing feedback to them in order to regulate their practices, or by making adaptive changes to some aspects of the collaborative setting; or implicitly, by making available to them representations of their activities.

In most cases these models require a tedious process for manual labeling the forum messages as training data. So, new methods are needed to reduce the human effort necessary for the preparation of such training datasets. In this study we follow an incremental approach in order to examine how soon after the beginning of a new course, we have collected enough data for training a supervised classification model. We show that by employing features that derive from a seeded topic modeling method, we achieve classifiers with reliable performance early enough in the course life, thus reducing significantly the human effort. The content of the MOOC platform is used to bias the topic extraction towards discussions related to (a) course content,(b) logistics, or (c) social interactions. Then, we develop a supervised model \u2026",

The integration with the laboratory setting and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been proposed to address this deficiency. Multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) like Second Life (SL) are 3D collaborative virtual environments that could act as complementary or alternative worlds for the implementation of laboratory PBL activities offering low-cost, safe, and always available environments. The aim of this study was to compare a simple laboratory PBL activity implemented in both the real and virtual worlds, in terms of learning outcome, satisfaction, and presence. The sample consisted of 150 undergraduate university students. The results show that the MUVE provided similar learning outcome and satisfaction to the real-world condition.

Finally, there are indications that the MUVE was perceived as more pleasurable and informal learning environment, while reality was perceived as more stressful. [Author abstract]",

People with diverse cognitive characteristics are engaged with varying CH activities (eg, games, guided visits) and considering that cognitive characteristics define the way we process information, our experience, behavior, and knowledge acquisition are influenced. Our recent studies provide evidence that human cognition should be considered as an important personalization factor within CH contexts, and thus, we developed a framework that delivers cognition-centered personalized CH activities. The efficiency and the efficacy of the framework have been successfully assessed, but, non-technical users may face difficulties when attempting to use it and create personalized CH activities.

An alternative framework, called \u201cObjectoriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF) is briefly presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the centre of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are \u2018owned\u2019by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF is based on both actions and dialogues of actors and allow deriving further qualitative as well as quantitative indicators of both solution quality and collaboration. Web-based tools supporting the OCAF approach are discussed. These tools are designed to be open in possible adaptations and able to be linked to various collaborative systems supporting diagrammatic problem solving.",

This is particularly important in the context of human-computer interaction courses that can relate to real life situations more easily than other theoretical or more technical subjects. This paper presents a teaching intervention in the context of a master's level course of Human-Computer Interaction and Design of Interactive Systems, during which a group of students were asked to address a critical problem, ie to evaluate and re-design typical Greek e-government sites. Given the importance of efficient and effective public sector services for the society's cohesion and citizens' inclusion, and the demand for improving their usability, in particular for the Greek case, it is argued \u2026",

Current educational uses of MUVEs seem to exploit them more as group interaction platforms and less as worlds where users learn by interacting and modifying the environment in a constructivist approach.

This paper presents preliminary empirical results from an exploratory study with university students. A collaborative problem-based physics learning activity was designed in Second Life\u00ae (SL), following a constructivist approach.

This article describes the adaptation, generalization and application of a rating scheme which had been developed by the Freiburg team for assessing collaboration quality on several dimensions [1]. The scheme was successfully adapted to suit data gathered by the Patras team in a different CSCL scenario. Collaboration quality is assessed by quantitative ratings of seven qualitatively defined rating dimensions. An empirical evaluation based on a dataset of 101 collaborative sessions showed high inter-rater agreement for all dimensions.",

            "Abstract": "Enterprise data present several difficulties when are used in data mining projects. Apart from being heterogeneous, noisy and disparate, they may also be characterized by major imbalances between the different classes. Predictive classification using imbalanced data necessitates methodologies that are adequate for such data, and particularly for the training of algorithms and evaluation of the resulting classifiers. This chapter suggests to experiment with several class distributions in the training sets and a variety of performance measures, especially those that are known to better expose the strengths and weaknesses of classification models. By combining classifiers into schemes that are suitable for the specific business domain, may improve predictions. However, the final evaluation of the classifiers must always be based on the impact of the results to the enterprise, which can take the form of a cost model that reflects requirements of existing knowledge. Taking a telecommunications company as an example, we provide a framework for handling enterprise data during the initial phases of the project, as well as for generating and evaluating predictive classifiers. We also provide the design of a decision support system, which embodies the above process with the daily routine of such company.",

            "Abstract": "Dual-language or multiple-language keyboards are widely used in many parts of the world, where users need to type in more than one scripts. During use of such keyboards, \u2018input mode errors\u2019 often occur when the user types in one language mode while the keyboard layout is set to a different one. These errors, along with frequent switching between input modes, are a source of confusion and distraction. In this paper we report on a study of this condition among Greek-speaking dual language keyboard users and describe a tool for automatically detecting this kind of errors and dealing with them in the case of an English-Greek keyboard. We also investigate the effects of this input mode error correction tool on a group of typical users during a study that lasted several days.",

            "Abstract": "An innovative framework of interaction and collaboration analysis is proposed, jointly with tools to support the process. The proposed framework is based on a collaboration analysis first and individual task analysis subsequently, approach. The objective of this framework is to facilitate understanding of the group's and individual user's tasks and goals and associate the artifacts used with usability problems. An innovative aspect of the framework is the association of tasks to artifacts (tools) engaged by the users during the activity. The typical use of this framework is in interactive systems evaluation and design. The framework and the tools functionality are described in the paper. The framework is inspired by the Activity Theory perspective, which recognizes the importance of artifacts, actors and the context in which an activity takes place.",

            "Abstract": "Monitoring and analysis of activities of small groups of students-collocated or at a distance-engaged in synchronous collaborative problem solving activity is the subject of this paper. This is discussed in the frame of Synergo, a new synchronous collaboration support environment that monitors the activity and permits visualization of various quantitative parameters, like density of interaction, symmetry of partners\u2019 activity, degree of collaboration etc, particularly useful for understanding the mechanics of collaboration. Synergo has been used for synchronous building of flow charts, concept maps, entity-relation diagrams and other semantic modeling activities by small groups of students and has been proposed as a testbed for micro-analysis of small scale interaction in order to gain an insight in collaborative learning.",

            "Abstract": "Scaffolding learners, i.e. helping learners to attain tasks they could not accomplish without support, entails the notion of fading, i.e. reducing the scaffolding for learners to become more and more self-regulated. Fading implies to tailor support for collaboration, such as collaboration scripts, to the particular needs of the specific collaborators. In computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) settings, support can be designed in a very restrictive and inflexible fashion; at the same time computerized settings open new possibilities for the realization of adaptive support as they enable automation of analysis and feedback mechanisms. In this symposium we present new technical approaches and latest empirical research on possibilities and limitations of adaptive support for learners in CSCL settings.",

            "Abstract": "This paper includes a review of mobile applications used in museum environments, focusing on the notion of context and its constituent dimensions. Museums are a representative example in which the context influences interaction. During a museum visit, the visitors interact with the exhibits through mobile devices. We argue that, effective interaction design needs to take into consideration multiple dimensions of the context. Since context is often misinterpreted, superficially used or poorly defined, we attempt to analyze a number of existing mobile applications used in museum environments, through this perspective. The point of analysis is to evaluate those applications against various context dimensions. We argue that these results can be useful in other kinds of applications, in which the impact of context is not taken for granted.",

            "Abstract": "This paper investigates aspects of learning in museums through mobile games, ie games that are played usually by groups of players, using mobile devices that allow interaction with the space and the exhibits and physical mobility of the players. It is argued that playing these games (which usually follow the pattern of scavenger hunt or role playing narratives), results in visitor engagement, motivation and knowledge about museum exhibits. Despite of these positive aspects, it has been observed that learning remains at the level of transfer of factual information about the exhibits. It is argued that in order to enrich the learning experience of game play we need to also involve the visitors in the process of designing mobile games for the museum.",

We examine if such distance can provide evidence of transferable linguistic features, suggesting transferability of forum classification models. For this purpose, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to extract the main discussion topics for each MOOC and proceeded to a pairwise semantic comparison between them. We focused on three categories of forum topics, i.e., Content-Related, Logistics-Related and Social Building. In the Content-Related discussions, the study confirmed semantic distance between the humanities course and the other four, while the distances among the mathematics and computing courses were shorter than expected. On the other hand, Logistics-Related and Social Building topics contained a more \u2026",

An experiment is described that took place in the frame of a University course. The main goal of the experiment was to evaluate the usability of the Testing and Self-evaluation component of the system. A complementary research goal was to explore the eventual impact of system usability on student performance. For this purpose, two alternative software components were compared that shared similar functionality, implemented in different ways (IDLE, WebCT). The usability evaluation was based on user questionnaires. From this experiment correlation between the software usability and student performance has emerged, underlining the importance of usability evaluation of systems supporting distance learning.",

            "Abstract": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security as it requires two pieces of evidence to be provided to an authentication mechanism before granting access to a user. However, people do not prefer 2FA; a reason for this is that 2FA requires performing extra actions. In this late-breaking work, we present UltraSonic Watch which provides a seamless 2FA through ultrasound. We report a small-scale within-subjects study (N= 30) which investigates the performance of UltraSonic Watch and the participants' experience (in terms of perception, preference, and willingness to adopt). The results are promising as they revealed that ultrasound can be used to provide an efficient 2FA mechanism, transparent to the users, who are positive in adopting such an approach to increase the security of the authentication process.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a flexible software environment that facilitates the use of machine learning techniques in power system contingency studies as an alternative to traditional power flow analysis. The architecture of this toolkit, which includes the database repository, and a number of machine learning tools are described. The toolkit approach enables the user to experiment with the predictive powers of various machine-learning tools over various network operating points. The paper covers the findings of a case study performing a sensitivity analysis using the presented software environment.",

The method is implemented as an automatic rater of collaboration quality and studied in a real time scenario of use. We argue that automatic and semi-automatic methods which provide assessments of collaboration quality or detect disorders and anomalies in collaborative activities should be further used to assist class monitoring. To that end, we study the routine of teachers when they monitor computer-supported collaborative activities with respect to the size of the classroom and the support of an automatic rater. We focus on the way the rater affects their task and how it can be further used to empower the practice of teachers.",

In the case of interacting with mobile devices and applications, users seek utility as they try to satisfy certain needs, but at the same time they have certain feelings and emotions when, for example, they feel attached to their personal phone and/or trust its brand. Due to this strong relation between users and mobile devices a significant problem occurs when researchers want to evaluate the user experience of a mobile application in laboratory settings: the selection of an appropriate mobile device. Towards this end, this paper aims to unveil the effect of perceived hedonic quality of a mobile device on the user experience evaluation results of an application. Our results show that the perceived hedonic quality of a mobile device significantly affected the perceived pragmatic quality of the application, but not the hedonic one.",

A novelty of the proposed service relies on the fact that it proposes a common data presentation format which is scalable, robust and extensible, thus allowing scientists from different applications areas to adapt their raw data and use the proposed service. This particular service introduces the most proper data mining technique by investigating several complementary principles like Bayesian networks, neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines and other core algorithms from the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The service has been effectively used in a case study which is briefly described.",

Daily content-based operations in an excavation such as saving artifact-related photos, dimensions and notes are supported as well as the communication of archaeologists and the coordination of their daily tasks. The application is built over a solid content structure suitable for these operations and is executed in modern smartphones by exploiting fully their spatial display and interface capabilities. Related work is examined and compared to the presented application. Following, the design philosophy and implementation details of the application are presented along with evaluation results and usage scenarios.",

The amount of information of today's websites, the continuous evolution of the medium and the heterogeneity of typical users' profiles, make the website design task particularly hard. The presented tools are mainly based on recent models of Web usage behavior, and involve various natural language and semantic similarity modeling methods. Validation studies of the presented tools have shown that they can support effectively various phases of the website design lifecycle including information structuring, hyperlink evaluation and assessment of alternative designs. In this paper, existing techniques are discussed, the aspects of Web design that (should and) could be better supported are identified and suggestions are made on \u2026",

Prior research has focused on qualitative methods for evaluating collaboration while machine learning algorithms and logfile analysis have been proposed for post-assessment. In this paper we propose the use of time series analysis techniques in order to classify synchronous, collaborative learning activities. Time is an important aspect of collaboration, especially when it takes place synchronously, and can reveal the underlying group dynamics. Therefore time series analysis should be considered as an option when we wish to have a clear view of the process and final outcome of a collaborative activity. We argue that classification of collaborative activities based on time series will also reflect on their qualitative aspects \u2026",

            "Abstract": "This paper describes our experience with introduction of synchronous collaborative problem solving activities in the frame of a distance learning computer science undergraduate course of the Hellenic Open University (HOU). Groups of students worked collaboratively at a distance in order to build a flowchart of an algorithm to a given problem. The technological and organization issues involved, the first findings of analysis of peer student interaction during this study, as well as some general implications for distance education are discussed.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe an innovative tool that supports the design and evaluation of the information architecture of a Web site. The tool uses Latent Semantic Analysis and hierarchical clustering algorithms to provide optimal information navigation schemes in an automated manner. The proposed, tool-based, approach addresses the problem of reasonable content structuring, which established techniques such as card sorting also address. A real world case study depicted substantial effectiveness gain, without expense in the quality of results. We argue that such an approach could facilitate information-rich applications design, like most Web sites, by reducing time and resources required.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of the research presented in this paper is to design a class of exploratory, constructivist and collaborative educational activities, mediated by handheld computers for a museum. Design decisions are influenced by pedagogical, technological and contextual issues which shape the design space. Our goal is to create a class of activities that give the students the opportunity to harvest information from artifacts that provided traditionally little interaction opportunities, while collaborate and actively explore the museum area in a personal way. To clarify our decisions, which constitute the proposed approach for constructivist educational activities using handheld computers, we outline the general setting, the interaction model presented to the students in order to use efficiently the mobile devices and the pedagogical goals under the prism of activity theory which drives our decisions. A typical example of our approach is discussed in the paper: the \u2018inheritance activity\u2019was introduced to young students visiting a Cultural-Historical Museum. Results of the study helped us to refine our design decisions and are discussed in detail in the following.",

The focus is on applications developed by organizations and individuals outside museums and cultural heritage organizations, with particular emphasis on comparing the results of this survey with previous research related to educational applications that have emerged from the museums themselves. The survey was based on analysis of the works presented at a recent symposium on learning activities in museums using ICT and has been developed based on dimensions such as the technology and its instrumental use, the kinds of activities presented, the space and the design teams. The main results was that use of the technology is for delivering information, although some designs do attempt to take into account other technology potential, the content of the museum and its special character as a learning context.",

Novel technologies, such as augmented reality, have been introduced to improve the performance and enhance the experience of the end-users. To provide navigation experiences with improved accuracy and decent stability, the developers of such tools can use persistent spatial points, which are stationary points in the real world that an augmented-reality system should keep track of over time. However, the use of persistent spatial points can dramatically increase the development effort, as it requires additional and time-consuming actions to be made by the developers.

Being motivated by Social Centrality Theory, this study aims at further enhancing our understanding of how social centrality is associated with the learners\u2019 course achievement within courses in different subjects (eg technology vs. humanities). To achieve this, we performed analysis of the discussion forums of two MOOCs of similar size and educational context, one on Programming and the other on History.

            "Abstract": "An increasing amount of data is collected today during studies in which students and educators are engaged in learning activities using information technology and other tools. These data are indispensable for analysis and evaluation of learning activities, for evaluation of new tools and for students\u2019 meta-cognitive activities. The data can take various forms, including video and audio recordings, log files of computing-related activity, field notes, results of students work in electronic or other forms, activity sheets etc. The need for analysis tools, which can annotate these data, classify them, process them and facilitate their inspection, is of increased importance especially for science education, since the latter involves experimentation and use of laboratory and other equipment that necessitate thorough off-line analysis and evaluation. In this paper we discuss first the key requirements of a new generation of interaction and collaboration analysis tools. We then present how these requirements have lead to the design of a prototype tool, recently developed. This tool can relate and synchronize various streams of field data. An important characteristic of the tool is its support for a multi-layer structure of annotations of various levels of abstraction, through which the activity can be interpreted and presented. This multi-layer representation can be inter-related to the raw field data, and can drive the navigation of the researcher in the activity data. An example of use of this tool for analysis and evaluation of a collaborative problem solving activity is also included.

However, it is necessary in order to support collaborative scenarios, to scaffold the collaborative knowledge building and to evaluate the learning outcome. Various automated techniques have been proposed to minimize the workload of human evaluators and speed up the process. In this study, we propose a memory based learning model for the analysis, classification and evaluation of collaborative activities that makes use of time series techniques along with logfile analysis. We argue that the classification of collaborative sessions, with respect to their time series attributes, may be related to their qualitative aspects. Based on this rationale, we explore the use of the model under various settings. The results of the model are compared to assessments made by expert evaluators using a rating scheme. Correlation and error analyses are further conducted.",

Analysis methods can be totally or partially supported by computer-based tools that provide for better and more efficient analysis processes. The current research in this field shows that most interaction analysis tools have been based on unstable prototypes, and are highly dependant on the learning environments and research goals for which they were defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to use them in authentic CSCL settings with real users. The goal of this European Research Team therefore is to utilize the synergies of experience in manual interaction analysis with computer-based analytical methods.

The method aims to classify collaborative activities using a memory-based learning model and to evaluate them using a reference set of pre-evaluated activities. The proposed approach uses time series to represent activities and classifies them regarding their similarity. In order to evaluate the results, the method is used as an automatic rater of collaboration quality and the ratings are compared to ratings of human experts.",

The tool is based on a theoretical model of users' behavior when engaged in information search tasks, called Information Foraging theory. A textual description of the user's search goal is compared with the textual description of each probable hyperlink, using Latent Semantic Analysis, a statistical technique that evaluates the distance between the two texts. Through this approach the most probable path that the user will follow in order to access the sought web page can be predicted. Thus, the tool can be used to evaluate the web site in terms of appropriateness of hyperlink text and of information architecture. We argue that the presented tool could substantially aid design and evaluation of a web site.",

This article adopts an innovative approach to CSCL analysis, involving the use of a rating scheme for the assessment of collaboration quality in several of its core dimensions. It involves appropriately trained evaluators that assign ratings on significant aspects of collaboration. Based on statistical analyses of ratings of 228 collaborating dyads working synchronously on a computer science problem-solving task, it reports and interprets interesting findings concerning general trends of collaborative practice, associations between dimensions of collaboration quality, and the way they relate to the quality of the problem's solution.",

This relatively new area of research requires new methodological approaches of interaction and problem solving analysis. Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called \u201cObject-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)\u201d is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a reversed view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are \u2018owned\u2019 by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development \u2026",

Analysis of the results showed that even small differences in the target-link\u2019s information scent can substantially affect users\u2019 performance, distribution of attention and confidence. The study contributes to the related literature by quantifying the impact of even small differences in the target-link\u2019s scent on users\u2019 success ratio, time for first click, confidence and distribution of attention. In addition, a scent threshold value was identified, below which all the measured variables were substantially affected, and thus the link could be characterized as of \u201cweak scent\u201d.",

Moreover, we assert that this can be achieved in an automated way. A small set of activity metrics, related to game characteristics and player activity, is applied to a set of gaming activities. The results are analyzed regarding team performance and score. The paper proposes a way to analyze group activity in the context of location-based games while taking into account the characteristics of successful collaborative activities. Future work is proposed towards the development of automated metrics for the analysis of location-based gaming activities with emphasis on collaboration and group dynamics.",

This introduces numerous challenges when delivering such experiences, given that people have different cognitive characteristics which influence the way we process information, experience, behave, and acquire knowledge. Our recent studies provide evidence that human cognition should be considered as a personalization factor within CH contexts, and thus we developed a framework that delivers cognition-centered personalized CH activities. The efficiency and the efficacy of the framework have been successfully assessed through two user studies, but non-technical professionals (eg, CH designers) may face difficulties when attempting to use it and create personalized CH activities. In this paper, we present DeCACHe, which supports CH designers in creating cognition-centered personalized CH activities throughout different phases of the design lifecycle. We also report a user study with seventeen professional CH designers, who used our tool to design CH activities for people with different cognitive characteristics. View Full-Text",

Analysis of students' peer interaction and of the produced solutions revealed that, contrary to our expectations, the group with heterogeneous resources produced solutions of similar quality to those of the reference group, although they were more active, they exchanged more messages, they were involved in deeper discussions and collaborated more for building the constituent parts of the solution.",

Considering that graphical authentication is associated with visual search, perception, and information retrieval, in this paper we report on an eye-tracking study (N = 109) that aimed to investigate the effects of users\u2019 cognitive styles toward the strength of the created passwords and shed light into whether and how the visual strategy of the users during graphical password composition is associated with the passwords\u2019 strength. For doing so, we adopted Witkin\u2019s Field Dependence-Independence theory, which underpins individual differences in visual information and cognitive processing, as graphical password composition tasks are associated with visual search. The analysis revealed that users with different cognitive processing characteristics followed different patterns of visual \u2026",

In this context the issue of Software Usability has gained prime importance. So computer professionals and the software industry need to put special attention in this issue. In this paper an introduction to the field of Software Usability is attempted. This is a prominent area of the discipline of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that studies interaction of humans and computer machinery and focuses on the design of interactive computer systems. The paper introduces a workshop on Software Usability, organised by the network of Excellence on Software Usability, which has been active for the last two years in Greece.",

However, people differ regarding the way they seek, retrieve, process, comprehend, organize and recall information, based on their individual perceptual characteristics, cognitive skills, abilities and styles. Therefore, the point and the motion of the eye gaze could reveal behavioural patterns related to individual cognitive differences; patterns that are extracted using eye tracking tools which quantify and provide compelling data regarding eye gaze movement.

The goal of this study was to develop a tool for assessing the strength and weaknesses in students\u2019 collaboration in large samples. A second goal was to show that the rating scheme\u2019s dimensions can capture the main aspects of effective collaboration across diverse settings. Adaptation of the rating scheme involved adjusting the dimensions' definitions to the affordances of the Synergo tool and characteristics of the given algorithm task, and testing it in a sample of six dyads selected from a broad range of studies. The final, adapted rating scheme includes seven dimensions:(i) collaboration flow,(ii) sustaining mutual understanding,(iii) exchanging knowledge and giving explanations,(iv) argumentation,(v) structuring the problem solving process and time management,(vi) cooperative orientation, and (vii) individual task orientation. For each dimension, we provide a detailed definition and case studies that illustrate how the rating scheme\u2019s dimensions can be used to describe and evaluate differentially the quality of students\u2019 collaboration. We outline perspectives for future research applying the newly developed rating scheme.",

Considering the diversity of visitors towards human cognition and the influence of individual cognitive differences on information comprehension, current visualization techniques could lead to unbalances regarding visitors\u2019 learning and experience gains. In this paper, we investigate whether the visualization of cultural-heritage content, tailored to the visitors\u2019 individual cognitive characteristics, would improve the comprehension of the cultural-heritage content. We followed a two-step experimental approach, and we conducted two small-scale between-subject eye-tracking studies (exploratory and comparative study), in which people with different cognitive style participated in a gallery tour. The analysis of the results of the exploratory study revealed that people with different cognitive style, differ in the way they process visual information, which influences the content comprehension. Based on these results we developed cognitivecentered visualizations and we performed a comparative study, which revealed that such visualizations could help the users towards content comprehension. In this respect, individual cognitive differences could be used as the basis for providing personalized experiences to cultural-heritage visitors, aiming to help them towards content-comprehension.",

            "Abstract": "Data Mining techniques have been applied in many application areas. A Data Mining project has been often described as a process of automatic discovery of new knowledge from large amounts of data. However the role of the domain knowledge in this process and the forms that this can take, is an issue that has been given little attention so far. Based on our experience with a large scale Data Mining industrial project we present in this paper an outline of the role of domain knowledge in the various phases of the process. This project has led to the development of a decision support expert system for a major Telecommunications Operator. The data mining process is described in the paper as a continuous interaction between explicit domain knowledge, and knowledge that is discovered through the use of data mining algorithms. The role of the domain experts and data mining experts in this process is \u2026",

A questionnaire-based survey combined with a real usage scenario of a native-language CAPTCHA mechanism was conducted in order to investigate several aspects that affect end-user perceptions related to the quality of CAPTCHA. A total of 210 participants of age between 19 and 64 participated during May and July 2010. The survey results validate the common belief that CAPTCHAs are still difficult for humans to solve. They also provide insights that can be applied to improve users' experience on interacting with CAPTCHA systems.",

In particular, context of use, social and constructivist aspects of learning and novel pedagogical approaches are important factors to be taken in consideration during the design process. A thorough study of existing systems is presented in the chapter in order to offer a background for extracting useful design approaches and guidelines.

Finding information hidden inside the vast amount of social media data is an overwhelming task especially for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that have limited resources. In this paper, we present an early prototype of SONETA, a social media geo-trend analysis tool that supports users, and specifically SMEs, by helping them detect social media trends in specific geographic areas. First, its architectural design and development process is delineated, followed by the presentation of a study that evaluated SONETA in terms of its usefulness and usability. Three SMEs participated in the SONETA evaluation study. Evaluation results showed that SONETA can be used in order to help SMEs in engaging social media more effectively.",

However performing at run time the necessary load flow analysis studies is a tedious and time consuming operation. An alternative solution is the off-line training and the run-time application of artificial neural networks.",

Prediction of customer insolvency, well in advance, and with an accuracy that could make this prediction useful in business terms, was one of the core objectives of the study. In the paper the process of building such a predictive model through knowledge discovery and data mining techniques in vast amounts of heterogeneous as well as noisy data is described. The reported findings are very promising, making the proposed model a useful tool in the decision making process, while some of the discussed problems and limitations are of interest to researchers who intend to use data mining approaches in other similar real-life problems.",

It has been found that it is possible to design learning activities with group sizes greater than two and that the group size affects performance and interaction. It was discovered that group skill balance in particular is an important aspect in this context. Therefore, the designer of such activities should design carefully the activity in order to get most benefits from the collaborative setting.",

The two games were commissioned to two historic regions of Greece, Tzoumerka and Movemvasia. In both we applied the notion of linking micro-narratives to specific locations. The objective of both games was to introduce the players through the short stories to the history of the places to which the stories referred. The stories offered to the players a view to sites of interest as lived-in spaces ie spaces where the characters of the story interacted and lived in the past. Game play consisted of situating the story in the location it was taking place (ie connecting the story to a specific location), giving points to the players when a correct association was made. The role of the player in relation to the narratives differed in the two cases. In the first game (taking place in Tzoumerka), the player was the reader, who had to identify the setting of the story, while in the second game the player had a specific role in the story and thus had to solve problems that could advance the story.",

One of the key factors of this problem is the lack of support and interactivity in MOOC discussion forums. The support provided to learners in MOOC forums is critical to retain their motivation. Teaching assistants (TAs) play a crucial role in providing support to learners within the discussion forums, so an interesting research subject is to study the approaches they follow. In this study, we investigate the TAs\u2019 instructional approaches through a mixed-methods approach. This has been performed on two MOOCs delivered through the OpenEdX platform. The goal was to assess the main characteristics of their interventions by using an evaluation framework derived from social constructivism theory and to capture the main issues of their approaches.

The websites were rated by the participants after viewing time of 500 ms in the first phase and with no time limit in the second. Within-website and within-rater consistency were examined in order to determine whether extremely short time period are enough to quickly form stable opinions about high level evaluative constructs besides visual appeal. We confirmed that quick and stable visual appeal judgments were made without the need of elaborate investigations and found evidence that this is also true for novelty.

This is mainly due to lack of training of Web designers on accessibility technology. This need is addressed, by ESALP, presented in this paper, a web-based application that is meant to be used as a tool to disseminate and teach Web accessibility guidelines and good design practices. The tool adopts an example-based learning approach. First, it exposes people to the accessibility impasses that arise when certain, established guidelines are violated, and then provides concise advice on how to avoid or resolve them. These examples were derived from an in-depth, Web accessibility evaluation study of 50 Greek websites. The results of this study, in agreement to similar studies, also indicated that the accessibility of the Greek Web is rather low. We argue that the presented tool could help in improving the accessibility of websites by increasing awareness, motivating and educating Web development stakeholders on the subject of accessibility.",

Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called \u201cObject-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)\u201d is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are \u2018owned\u2019by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF is based on both actions and dialogues of actors, providing qualitative as well as quantitative indicators of collaboration and solution quality. The paper presents first the framework notation. Examples of its use in analysis of distance groups and face-to-face collaborative activities are provided next, followed by the dimensions of the framework supported analysis for teachers and researchers. Web-based tools supporting the OCAF approach are also presented.",

The study is based on an environmental field of application employing data from two air quality prediction problems, a toxicity classification problem and four artificially produced datasets. The results contain evaluation of classification criteria for every algorithm and noise level for the noise sensitivity study.

The DVAL is designed and implemented as a groupware system to support co-operation in a scientific group of an academic department. The issues related with co-operation in scientific and other knowledge-intensive environments are particularly complex and need special attention. Groupware applications, like the one presented here, have demonstrated that computer-mediated co-operation is particularly difficult to achieve. The fundamental concept underpinning the DVAL design is based on the hypothesis that the scientific co-ordinates of a researcher, who belongs to a research community, can be determined by the classification indexes and keywords, of the documents (books, journals, etc.) used \u2026",

In particular, we propose four different ways to have information foraging theory informing the design. Directives, to ensure proper learning content structuring and cues with strong scent, tools based on LSA to automate the design and evaluation process, methods to construct archetypal learner\u2019s profiles from user data and added functions to realise collaborative information filtering and personal information patch creation, thus allowing learners to organize their reference \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The process of opening up course ware and in general education is often tedious, in particular for small to medium size public Universities. This is particularly the case in recent times that these Institutions strive for resources as cuts and austerity measures affect public education. Yet in Greece, in the middle of a major economic crisis the Open Courseware project was implemented as a large scale action aiming at development of open courses in many Greek Universities. The University of Patras was particularly active in this. It develops a large number of open courses by the end of 2015 in many different disciplines. The lessons learned during the process are discussed in this paper, with main focus on technological and organizational problems and pitfalls, faculty reservations and attitudes, often found in Universities with similar characteristics.",

There is lately a strong interest for case studies on the password habits of populations with different cultures and/or languages. In this paper, we augment the existing literature with a case study of Greek web sites. We analyze clear text and encrypted passwords for almost 19,000 accounts and we draw conclusions on similarities with and oppositions to alike empirical studies. Our findings indicate that a significant percentage of users chooses easily-guessed passwords. The average password length is less than 7 characters and most passwords contain only letters and numbers. However, there are users that prefer passwords containing characters from the Greek alphabet. Such passwords are much harder to guess and our proposal is to encourage their usage.",

Both approaches implement abstracting mechanisms along the space and time dimensions of the supervised process.

The market validation of the different services has been performed in different environments, private and state schools, from different geographical areas; Greece, Spain and North Ireland in the UK, in order to confirm the business model developed and the services acceptance. Outcomes show that e-COMODE services benefit schools by providing mechanisms to solve the lack of sufficient and appropriate teacher's support to incorporate new technologies in their teaching practices, to implement collaborative learning in the educational systems and the learning via computer based modelling. Although end-users (teachers, students) have already adopted the e-COMODE facilities, the barriers for the exploitation of the services are at the level of the public administration. Therefore, the business model proposed is being revised in function of the experience gathered during the market validation.",

The DVAL is designed and implemented as a groupware system to support co-operation in a scientific group of an academic department. The issues related with co-operation in scientific and other knowledge-intensive environments are particularly complex and need special attention. Groupware applications, like the one presented here, have demonstrated that computer-mediated co-operation is particularly difficult to achieve. The fundamental concept underpinning the DVAL design is based on the hypothesis that the scientific co-ordinates of a researcher, who belongs to a research community, can be determined by the classification indexes and keywords, of the documents (books, journals, etc.) used in their scientific work. These classification indices are based on a unified, commonly accepted, and dynamically expandable reference framework. Thus, the dynamic tracing of the team's scientific interests is possible for all community members. Consequently, a loose co-operative environment is established among the users, based on the knowledge of each other's evolving scientific interests. In this paper, we report the basic design features of the distributed system prototype and the supported interaction mechanisms. Much emphasis is put on the methods for the documentation subject indexing and the user modelling via the interests profiles mechanism.",

In this paper we describe Taggling, a game designed for a Contemporary Art Museum, focusing in particular in the learning patterns observed in visitors of the museum when playing the game. Taggling is like a card sorting game where players are engaged in untangling a set of tags that describe different artworks so as each tag to be placed in the corresponding artwork. Based on two limited evaluation sessions, Taggling shows the potential to successfully engaging the players with the artworks.

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses our experience with designing and implementing a new Introduction to Computing course that aims both to introduce students to programming and at the same time to cover key concepts of Computer Science using a hands-on experiential approach. The re-design of the course has put more emphasis on using Python as a tool for studying computer science. It was found that the students enjoyed this approach and responded positively to the challenge. Examples are given on how concepts of binary arithmetic, computer architecture, operating systems, networking have been introduced through Python coding examples and exercises, while the project work introduced the students to the challenges of software development.",

            "Abstract": "An increasing amount of data is collected today during studies in which students and educators are engaged in learning activities using information technology and other tools. These data are indispensable for analysis and evaluation of learning activities, for evaluation of new tools and for students\u2019 meta-cognitive activities. The data can take various forms, including video and audio recordings, log files of computing-related activity, field notes, results of students work in electronic or other forms, activity sheets etc. The need for analysis tools, which can annotate these data, classify them, process them and facilitate their inspection, is of increased importance especially for science education, since the latter involves experimentation and use of laboratory and other equipment that necessitate thorough off-line analysis and evaluation. In this paper we discuss first the key requirements of a new generation of interaction and collaboration analysis tools. We then present how these requirements have lead to the design of a prototype tool, recently developed. This tool can relate and synchronize various streams of field data. An important characteristic of the tool is its support for a multi-layer structure of annotations of various levels of abstraction, through which the activity can be interpreted and presented. This multi-layer representation can be inter-related to the raw field data, and can drive the navigation of the researcher in the activity data. An example of use of this tool for analysis and evaluation of a collaborative problem solving activity is also included.",
