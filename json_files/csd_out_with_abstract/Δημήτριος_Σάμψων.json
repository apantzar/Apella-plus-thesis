            "Abstract": "Researchers have been working to understand the high dropout rates in computer science (CS) education. Despite the great demand for CS professionals, little is known about what influences individuals to complete their CS studies. We identify gains of studying CS, the (learning) environment, degree\u2019s usefulness, and barriers as important predictors of students\u2019 intention to complete their studies in CS (retention). The framework aims to identify reasons that may contribute to dropout, using responses from 344 CS students. The eight-predictor model accounts for 39 % of the explained variance in student retention. A high level for degree\u2019s usefulness has a positive effect on retention. Further, cognitive gains and supportive environment positively impact degree\u2019s usefulness, while non-cognitive gains hinder it. Lastly, negative feelings (personal values) are found to reduce student retention. The overall \u2026",

EDL is conceptualized as the ability to collect, manage, analyse, comprehend, interpret, and act upon educational data in an ethical, meaningful, and critical manner. The professionals in the field of digitally supported education, i.e., Instructional Designers (IDs) and e-Tutors (eTUTs) of online and blended courses, need to be ready to inform their decisions with educational data, and face the upcoming data-related challenges; they need to update and enhance their profiles with relevant competences. This paper proposes a framework for EDL competence profiles of IDs/eTUTs and evaluates the proposal with the participation of worldwide professionals (N\u2009=\u2009210) with experience in digitally supported education. The evaluation aims at validating the proposal and assesses (a) the current EDL-readiness of IDs/eTUTs; and (b) the extent to which the framework captures and describes the essential EDL competences. The findings indicate that professionals are not EDL-competent yet, but the proposed dimensions and related competences are offering a solid approach to support EDL development.",

However, although a number of e-training systems are designed to meet accessibility needs and preferences for those groups, most of them anticipate special-purpose training material and keep their training activities local to the system. Such approaches do not facilitate their users (both learners and their tutors) in accessing other digital educational resources widely available in web repositories, and they do not support the sharing of best training practices among the communities of practitioners and organizations.

However, the current level of school ICT uptake remains low, due to the interrelation of a wide range of factors, including teachers' ICT competences and strategic school Leadership planning. In this context, there is a need for systems that will facilitate schools in capturing the contribution of these factors and meaningfully process the data for informed strategic planning. The aim of this paper is to present a web-based system, namely the ASK School ICT Competence Management System, which takes a step towards the aforementioned needs for effective school ICT uptake monitoring and management.",

            "Abstract": "A novel combined frequency and spatial domain method is presented in this paper for blockiness reduction for low bit rate compressed images. The method consists of two stages: in the first, better estimates of the reconstructed DCT coefficients are obtained based on their observed probability distribution. In the second, an efficient postprocessing scheme consisting of a region classification algorithm and a spatial adaptive filtering is applied for blockiness removal. The type of filtering is decided on the basis of an estimation of the local characteristics of the coded image. The main advantage of the proposed method is the efficient combination and design of these two stages which are acting complementarily for the reduction of blocking artifacts. This approach is shown to produce excellent results in removing blocking artifacts. The efficient performance of the proposed algorithm is due, firstly, to the proposition that the shape and the position of the filter kernel are adjusted according to the characteristics of the local image region and secondly, to the employment of the modified improved DCT coefficients by the postprocessing filter. Experimental results illustrating the performance of the proposed method are presented and evaluated.",

To support the provision of competence-based learning services, it is necessary to be able to maintain a record of an individual's competences in a persistent and standard way. In this paper, we investigate potential issues related with the definition of a common metadata model for competencies description. This is done by applying the current state-of-the-art specification, IMS Reusable Definition of Competency or Educational Objective (IMS RDCEO), in a real case study, that is, the EuroPass Language Passport. We, then, identify four open issues with the description capabilities of the IMS RDCEO specification, and propose possible extensions to its information model, demonstrating their application in practice.",

During the last few years, technological advancements (such as ubiquitous devices and wearable computers) and innovative applications (such as data analysis tools, simulations, augmented reality and virtual reality interfaces) have allowed the enhancement and enrichment of the current science education curricula (Rocard et al. 2007). Furthermore, a large amount of digital science education resources have become available worldwide through science museum collections and digital repositories such as Exploratorium Museum of Science (www. exploratorium. edu/), Science Museum of Minnesota (www. smm. org/) and NASA\u2019s Education Materials Finder (http://search. nasa. gov/search/edFilterSearch. jsp? empty= true), all of which aim to facilitate sharing and re-use of digital science education resources among science education communities. These resources have the potential to support technology-enhanced science education by enabling science teachers to improve their day-to-day science teaching (Rajashekar et al. 2007).On the other hand, it has been recognised that science teachers could improve the quality of their teaching and support their motivation for enriching their teaching practices through their participation in communities of best science teaching practices, which facilitate sharing of not only digital educational resources, but also educational practices that represent their pedagogical approach. More specifically, science teachers are able through their participation in communities of teaching practices to:(a) search and \u2026",

The main advantage of LOs is considered to be their potential for component-based reusability in different learning settings. However, despite the importance of the concept of reusability and its potential benefits in educational content production and deployment, there is not a consistent framework for LOs reusability that would allow organizations to assess the conditions and eventually implement systematic LOs reuse. This is a drawback in adopting the LOs paradigm towards reducing costs and effort, while maintaining high quality. In this paper, we study the process of reusing LOs within the context of a technology-enhanced learning activities design and development and propose a consistent framework for LOs reusability which has been \u2026",

The main objective of such initiatives is to support the process of organizing, classifying, and storing LOs and their associated metadata in Web-based repositories which are called learning object repositories (LORs). Within this framework, popular ways for describing LOs are the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES) and the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (LOM) Standard. However, it has been recognized that it is not possible for generic standards such as DCMES and IEEE LOM to be used to fully meet community and context-specific users\u2019 needs.

This limits the flexibility of these engines in terms of extensions and inter-exchange with other systems and applications. A possible solution to this problem \u2026",

            "Abstract": "During the past years, inquiry based teaching has been recognized as a pedagogical strategy for improving science education in many European countries. Within this context, teachers are recognized as key players for the effective widespread use of inquiry based science teaching techniques in school education [1]. Furthermore, it has been recognized that science education teachers could significantly improve the quality of their teaching and support their motivation for adopting inquiry based teaching practices through their participation in communities of best science teaching practices, which facilitates them to share, not only digital educational resources, but also learning designs that reflect their teaching practice, discuss about best teaching practices and reflect on each others\u2019 designs [2].Within this framework, there are international efforts for moving beyond traditional web-based repositories of digital educational resources towards the design and development of web-based repositories of learning designs. Nevertheless, the process of developing and sharing learning designs through web-based repositories requires:(a) Learning Design Authoring Tools that can represent the pedagogical design followed in educational scenarios, that is, a structured flow of learning activities populated with educational resources and facilitated by certain tools and devices, where teachers and students participate assuming certain roles [3],(b) Strategies for using these tools so as to express the learning designs following consistent and commonly recognized terms among the educational practitioners of a given community [4].",

In this paper, a novel technique is proposed to alleviate the blocking artifacts that usually occur in JPEG coded images especially at low bit rates. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: firstly, the AC coefficients are estimated based on their observed probability distribution and secondly, a postprocessing scheme is applied for blockiness removal, consisting of a region classification algorithm and a spatial adaptive filtering. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

This paper provides an approach to build and adapt a tutoring model by using both artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning. The underlying idea is that tutoring rules can be, firstly, learned by observing human tutors' behavior and, then, adapted, at run-time, by observing how each learner reacts within a learning environment at different states of the learning process. The Zone of Proximal Development has been adopted as the underlying theory to evaluate efficacy and efficiency of the learning experience.",

The World Wide Web has considerable potential to expand and improve PjBL environments. However, making implicit aspects of a programming task accessible to learners and instructors to support reflection and improvement can be challenging. This paper discusses the challenge of PjBL in programming education and outlines a set of key aspects and an analysis framework to inform design and analysis of PjBL programming in web-based environments, by exploiting the emerging field of Teaching and Learning Analytics. Based on the proposed analysis framework, the design of an empirical study is outlined, capitalizing on a novel web-based PjBL environment that makes complex cognitive processes accessible and affords the analysis of its effects on learning programming in multiple aspects.",

Current decentralized systems still focus on data and knowledge as their main resource. Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) techniques and the support of agent systems with scaling and decentralized control. Synergy between grids, P2P systems, and agent technologies is the key to data-and knowledge-centered systems in large-scale environments. This volume, the 21st issue of Transactions on Large-Scale Data-and Knowledge-Centered Systems, focuses on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery from Big Data, and contains extended and revised versions of eight papers selected as the best papers from the 14th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK 2012), held in Vienna, Austria, during September 3-6, 2012. These papers cover several advanced Big Data topics, ranging from data cube computation using MapReduce to multiple aggregations over multidimensional databases, from data warehousing systems over complex energy data to \u2026",

Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards web-based educational systems tailored to specific pedagogical approaches. The most advanced of them are based on the ADL Sharable Content Object Reference Model in order to enable sharing and reusability of the learning content. However, sharing of learning activities among different web-based educational systems still remains an open issue. In this paper we first examine the limitations of the current state-of-the art authoring tools and investigate the use of the Learning Design framework as a mean to address those limitations. Then, we propose a high-level architecture of a learning activities generator and the supporting SCORM compatible authoring system that utilizes the Learning \u2026",

The implementation of a Tutoring Model includes both the formal representation of the aforementioned rules and a mechanism able to interpret such representation and execute the rules. One of the most suitable approaches to formally represent pedagogical rules is to construct semantic web ontologies that are highly interoperable and can be integrated with other models in an ITS like the subject domain and the student model. However, the main drawback of semantic web-based approaches is that they require a considerable human effort to prepare and build relevant ontologies.

Therefore, we propose the layered evaluation framework, where the success of adaptation is addressed at two distinct layers: user modelling and adaptation decision making. We outline how layered evaluation can improve the current evaluation practice of ALS. To build a stronger case for a layered evaluation, we re-visit the evaluation of the InterBook where the layered approach can provide a difference and provide an example of its use in KOD learning system.",

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, several research initiatives have investigated the potentials of the educational paradigm shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all teaching approaches to adaptive and personalized learning. On the other hand, mobile devices are recognized as an emerging technology to facilitate teaching and learning strategies that exploit individual learners\u2019 context. This has led to an increased interest on context-aware adaptive and personalized mobile learning systems aiming to provide learning experiences delivered via mobile devices and tailored to learner\u2019s personal characteristics and situation. To this end, in this paper we present a context-aware adaptive and personalized mobile learning system, namely the Units of Learning mobile Player (UoLmP), which aims to support semi-automatic adaptation of learning activities, that is: (a) adaptations to the interconnection of the learning activities (namely \u2026",

An analysis of collaborative Web exploration activities supported by shared displays\u201d is by Chia-Jung Chung, Chen-Chung Liu, and Yan-Jhin Shen, all of whom are from Taiwan. This paper is consistent with the dual theme of the conference emphasizing the role of cloud-based resources and assessment. The study these authors report involves the effect of having a shared computer with a small group exploring Web resources versus having one-to-one computers which shared displays. The findings suggest that the one-to-one computer treatment with shared displays was more effective in promoting collaboration and elaboration of the findings of Web explorations.The second paper entitled \u201cCurriculum-guided crowd sourcing of assessments in a developing country\u201d is by Imran Zualkernan (UAE), Anjana Raza (Pakistan), and Asad Karim (Pakistan). As the title directly implies, this paper also addressed both themes of the conference. The authors report the findings of an exploratory study aimed at determining if teachers in a developing country were able to create high quality, multiple-choice questions for elementary school students. The notion of crowd sourcing assessments was introduced to explore the willingness of the teachers to share their assessment items. Not surprisingly, the findings suggest that those with a readiness for adoption of new assessments had better attitudes and enjoyed the activity. However, there was no clear indication of which factors contributed to high quality items, although most of the teachers willingly embraced the activity.",

Co-tagging networks have been studied by applying social network analysis (SNA) metrics so as to: (a) draw significant insights about the influence of central users to the (tagging) behaviour of other users and (b) identify clusters of taggers based on the content of the tags that they use. Nevertheless, there are no previous works, which have studied co-tagging networks in the field of Learning Object Repositories (LORs).

            "Abstract": "Over the last decade, a number of international efforts have led to the development of specifications and standards in the field of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) that are related with online course design, packaging and delivery. Examples include the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) and the IMS Learning Design (LD) Specification. These standards aim to allow online courses to be designed and packaged in a commonly agreed machine-readable format that can be used by different delivery systems, referred to as course players. On the other hand, the widespread ownership of mobile devices has led to research initiatives that investigate the potential educational benefits from enabling learners\u2019 access to online courses without place and device constraints. Nevertheless, most course players are currently developed with desktop PCs as the delivery end. Existing mobile course players mainly support SCORM but not IMS LD and most of them are commercial products. As a result, there are limited open-source implementations of mobile course players, which support delivery of online courses and conform with SCORM or IMS LD. This chapter takes stock of the current landscape of available commercial and/or open-source mobile course players and describes an open-source mobile course player suitable for delivering SCORM courses\u2014namely, the ASK Mobile SCORM Player\u2014as well as an open-source mobile course player suitable for delivering IMS LD courses\u2014namely, the ASK Mobile LD Player.",

In this work, we build upon the experience from the BlindHelper smartphone outdoor pedestrian navigation app and present Blind MuseumTourer, a system for indoor interactive autonomous navigation for blind and visually impaired persons and groups (eg, pupils), which has primarily addressed blind or visually impaired (BVI) accessibility and self-guided tours in museums. A pilot prototype has been developed and is currently under evaluation at the Tactual Museum with the collaboration of the Lighthouse for the Blind of Greece. This paper describes the functionality of the application and evaluates candidate indoor location determination technologies, such as wireless local area network (WLAN) and surface-mounted assistive tactile route indications combined with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and inertial dead-reckoning functionality, to come up with a reliable and highly accurate indoor positioning system adopting the latter solution. The developed concepts, including map matching, a key concept for indoor navigation, apply in a similar way to other indoor guidance use cases involving complex indoor places, such as in hospitals, shopping malls, airports, train stations, public and municipality buildings, office buildings, university buildings, hotel resorts, passenger ships, etc. The presented Android application is effectively a Blind IndoorGuide system for accurate and reliable blind indoor navigation.

In order to adaptively select and sequence learning objects in AEHS, the definition of adaptation behavior, referred to as Adaptation Model, is required. Several efforts have been reported in literature aiming to support the Adaptation Model design by providing AEHS designers either guidance for the direct definition of adaptation rules, or semi-automatic mechanisms for making the design process less demanding via the implicit definition of such rules. The main drawback of the direct definition of adaptation rules is that there can be cases during the run-time execution of AEHS where no adaptation decision can be made, due to inconsistency, and/or insufficiency of the defined adaptation rule sets.

The internal details of systems that utilize these metadata are still an open issue since these efforts are primarily dealing with\" what\" and not\" how\". In this chapter, under the light of these emerging standardization efforts, we present XDevice, an intelligent XML repository system for educational metadata. XDevice can be used as the intelligent back-end of a WWW portal on which\" learning objects\" are supplied by educational service providers and accessed by learners according to their individual profiles and educational needs. XDevice transforms the widely adopted XML binding for educational metadata into a flexible, object-oriented representation and uses intelligent second-order logic querying facilities to provide advanced, personalized functionality. Furthermore, a case study is presented, in which learning object metadata and learner's profile metadata are combined under certain XDevice rules in order to dynamically infer customized courses for the learner.",

The concept of communities of practice has been proposed by Lave and Wenger [2], who define a Community of Practice (CoP) as:\u201ca group of people who share an interest, a craft, and/or a profession. It can evolve naturally because of the member's common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created specifically with the objective of gaining knowledge related to their area of interest\u201d. CoPs that are facilitated by web-technologies are referred to as web-facilitated communities of practice or virtual communities of practice [3, 4].The concept of CoP has also become very popular in the field of education and learning. As a result, educational communities of practice are being developed focusing on generating, sharing and reusing different types of educational knowledge [5]. The different types of educational knowledge, which can be generated and shared within educational communities of practice, can be divided into two types [6]:",

However, using a RVL to teach a specific science subject might not be a straightforward task for a science teacher. As a result, science teachers need to be able to find existing lesson plans supported by RVLs (designed by other science teachers), so as to (a) be informed on how specific RVLs can be used in the context of a science education lesson and (b) be inspired and possibly adapt existing lesson plans supported by RVLs to cover their specific teaching needs. The most common way to facilitate this process using web technologies is to (a) characterize lesson plans with appropriately selected educational metadata and (b) to build a web repository that collects the metadata descriptions of lesson plans following a common metadata schema and offers search and retrieval facilities. Within this context, the scope of this paper is twofold: (a) to propose a metadata schema that can be used for characterizing school science education lesson plans supported by RVLs and (b) to validate this metadata schema with 82 European school science teachers that was performed in the framework of a major European Initiative namely, the Go-Lab project, so as to identify which metadata elements are considered important when science teachers are searching in web-based repositories.",

Moreover, the proliferation of mobile devices has created a growing trend for developing mobile virtual labs. However, the process of designing and developing such mobile apps should be based on specific guidelines towards addressing the technical restrictions of mobile devices and improving end-user experience. Existing guidelines that aim to facilitate this process are the App Quality Alliance (AQuA) guidelines. In this paper, we identify common functionalities of existing mobile virtual labs and we exploit AQuA guidelines towards proposing a method for developing mobile virtual labs. Additionally, we apply this method for developing a mobile virtual lab, namely ASK Mobile Virtual Laboratory (ASK-MVL \u2026",

However, these processes can be cumbersome, especially given that existing 'School Analytics' methods aiming to support them have mainly focused on the former task, but have yet to explicitly address the latter. In this context, the paper presents and initially validates a novel School Analytics approach, which employs fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis as the means to provide leaders with actionable insights on how to create the school conditions for fostering students' learning outcomes, focusing on 'digital skills' as a case study.",

            "Abstract": "Subject Ontologies represent conceptualizations of disciplinary domains in which concepts symbolize topics that are relevant for the considered domain and are associated each other by means of specific relations. Usually, these kind of lightweight ontologies are adopted in knowledge-based educational environments to enable semantic organization and search of resources and, in other cases, to support personalization and adaptation features for learning and teaching experiences. For this reason, applying effective management methodologies for Subject Ontologies is a crucial aspect in engineering the environments. In particular, this paper proposes an approach to use SKOS (a Semantic Web-based vocabulary providing a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems) for modelling subject ontologies. Moreover, the paper underlines the main benefits of SKOS. It focuses on alternative strategies \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The emerging Web 2.0 applications have allowed new ways of characterizing digital educational resources, which moves from the expert-based descriptions relying on formal classification systems such as the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (LOM) to a less formal user-based tagging. This alternative way of characterizing digital educational resources is commonly referred to as social tagging, whereas the collection of tags created by the different users individually is referred to as folksonomy. As a result, a number of studies have been reported in the field of Technology-enhanced Learning (TeL) which provide evidence that social tagging has the potential to enlarge metadata descriptions, as well as the formal structured vocabularies with additional terms derived by the resulted folksonomy but more in depth studies are needed regarding this enlargement process. Thus, one issue to investigate further is the possible \u2026",

In this paper we present a schema-mapping algorithm that is capable of transforming the metadata description of an educational object created using specific metadata specification to a representation of the same object using either another specification, or the same specification in another language. We show that using advanced conversion techniques such as the proposed algorithm can result in lower standardization efforts. Simulation results over a wide range of learning objects demonstrate that the proposed algorithm except from requiring less human intervention, can handle real case mapping problems between not only different metadata models but also between models that use different standards for data representation.",

Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards Web-based educational systems tailored to specific pedagogical approaches. The main drawback of those systems is that they are closed, self-contained systems that cannot interexchange either educational content or activities. On the other hand, several learning management systems already exist delivering Web-based courses with limited pedagogical flexibility, but are able to share/exchange learning content in the form of learning objects. The most advanced of them are based on the IEEE Learning Technology Systems Architecture and use standardized content structuring based on the ADL shamble content object reference model.

The main drawback of the direct definition of adaptation rules is that there can be cases during the run-time execution of AEHS where no adaptation decision can be made, due to insufficiency and/or inconsistency of the pre-defined adaptation rule sets. The goal of the semi-automated, decision-based approaches is to generate a continuous decision function that estimates the desired AEHS response, aiming to overcome the above mentioned problem. However, such approaches still miss a commonly accepted framework for evaluating their performance. In this chapter, we review the design approaches \u2026",

These resources bare the potential to support technology-enhanced science education by enabling science education teachers to improve their day-to-day science teaching. On the other hand, it has been identified that science education teachers could benefit from their participation in communities of best science teaching practices by sharing, not only digital educational content, but learning designs that reflect their pedagogical practice. This has lead to efforts on moving beyond web-based repositories of digital content towards the development of web-based repositories of learning designs. Nevertheless, sharing learning designs requires tools and strategies, so as to facilitate the representation of these \u2026",

In most intelligent learning systems that incorporate course sequencing techniques, learning object selection is based on a set of teaching rules according to the cognitive style or learning preferences of the learners. In spite of the fact that most of these rules are generic (ie, domain independent), there are no well-defined and commonly accepted rules on how the learning objects should be selected and how they should be sequenced to make\" instructional sense.\" Moreover, to design highly adaptive learning systems a huge set of rules is required, since dependencies between educational characteristics of learning objects and learners are rather complex.

In detail, we offer a step by step approach on the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Learning analytics gain increased popularity, however studies use traditional symmetric statistical methods to analyze them. Building on the theory of complexity and configuration theory we suggest on using fsQCA in order to gain a deeper understanding of the data, which may lead to understanding different learning phenomena as well as to the creation of new theories. We further describe the steps on how to perform a contrarian case analysis, which will help in identifying asymmetric relations among the data. Finally, testing for predictive validity with fsQCA is explained. Many of the steps described here may be implemented in various contexts, however we tried to provide examples and instructions for learning analytics oriented research.",

Recent studies have proposed adopting a layered evaluation approach, according to which recommender systems may be decomposed into several components, evaluating each of them separately. Nevertheless, there are still no evaluation studies of recommender systems that apply a layered evaluation framework to explore how all the different components or layers of such a system may be assessed. This paper introduces layered evaluation and examines how a previously proposed layered evaluation framework for adaptive systems can be applied in the case of recommender systems. It presents the possible adaptation of this out a retrospective analysis of its past evaluation results under the new prism that the layered evaluation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Technological advancements in the field of World Wide Web have led to a plethora of remote and virtual labs (RVLs) that are currently available online and they are offered with or without cost. However, using a RVL to teach a specific science subject might not be a straightforward task for a science teacher. As a result, science teachers need to be able to find existing lesson plans supported by RVLs (designed by other science teachers), so as to (a) be informed on how specific RVLs can be used in the context of a science education lesson and (b) be inspired and possibly adapt existing lesson plans supported by RVLs to cover their specific teaching needs. The most common way to facilitate this process using web technologies is to (a) characterize lesson plans with appropriately selected educational metadata and (b) to build a web repository that collects the metadata descriptions of lesson plans following a common metadata schema and offers search and retrieval facilities. Within this context, the scope of this paper is twofold:(a) to propose a metadata schema that can be used for characterizing school science education lesson plans supported by RVLs and (b) to validate this metadata schema with 82 European school science teachers that was performed in the framework of a major European Initiative namely, the Go-Lab project, so as to identify which metadata elements are considered important when science teachers are searching in web-based repositories.",

Learner modelling and digital learning resources description parameters are inferred by a classic cognitive style modelling method, the Honey and Mumford model. We study two different aspects in modelling the learning resources recommendation problem: first formulated as a decision problem for the agent representing the learner by using a unique synthesis criterion approach; second, as a decision problem for the agent representing the content provider by using an approach based on the UTA method.

CELDA aims to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes, supporting pedagogies and technology applications. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns.

The reasons for this are multifaceted and include, among others, staff competences, financial issues, infrastructure-related shortcomings and culture factors. This complexity in approaching the problem is attributed to the fact that schools are, in themselves, a wide ecosystem of interrelating (f)actors. Deriving from this, the need for a method to effectively capture all these factors and their level of contribution to the overall schools\u2019 ICT uptake is essential. Towards that end, this chapter aims to investigate and outline a framework for profiling schools\u2019 ICT competences, which extends the current eMaturity implementations and, building on the concept of organizational competence \u2026",

On the other hand, mobile devices are recognized as an emerging technology to facilitate teaching and learning strategies that exploit individual learners\u2019 context. This has led to an increased interest on context-aware adaptive and personalized mobile learning systems aiming to provide learning experiences delivered via mobile devices and tailored to learner's personal characteristics and situation. To this end, in this paper we present a context-aware adaptive and personalized mobile learning system, namely the Units of Learning mobile Player (UoLmP), which aims to support semi-automatic adaptation of learning activities, that is: (a) adaptations to the interconnection of the learning activities (namely, the learning flow) and (b) adaptations to the educational resources, tools and services that support the learning activities. Initial evaluation results from the use of UoLmP provide evidence that UoLmP can successfully adapt the learning flow of an educational scenario and the delivery of educational resources, tools and services that support the learning activities. Finally, these adaptations can facilitate students to complete successfully the learning activities of an educational scenario",

            "Abstract": "The need for e-learning systems that support a diverse set of pedagogical requirements has been identified as an important issue in web-based education. Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards web-based educational systems tailored to specific pedagogical approaches. The most advanced of them are based on the IEEE Learning Technology Systems Architecture and use standardized content structuring based on the ADL Sharable Content Object Reference Model in order to enable sharing and reusability of the learning content. However, sharing of learning activities among different web-based educational systems still remains an open issue. On the other hand, existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) provide authoring tools that are only tailored to the capabilities of the specific system in hand. The open question is how web-based educational systems should be designed in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "During the past years a number of international efforts have led to the development of the IEEE LOM standard as a commonly accepted way for describing educational resources, facilitating storage, search and retrieval of these resources through web-based repositories. On the other hand, it was recognized early enough that it is not possible for a generic standard such as IEEE LOM to meet specific requirements and accommodate the particular needs of different educational communities. As a result, a practice of generating Application Profiles (APs) of the IEEE LOM has emerged and a number of different APs have been developed worldwide. However, despite the widespread development of APs it seems that a limited number of software tools exist, aiming to support the process of IEEE LOM Application Profiling. Moreover, these tools have a number of limitations, adding extra barriers to their users in this process \u2026",

The goal of this tutorial was to disseminate knowledge on elementary data analysis tools as well as facilitate simple practical data analysis activities with the purpose of stimulating reflection on the great potential of large datasets. In particular, during the tutorial we introduce elementary tools for using machine learning models in education. Although the methodology presented here applies in any programming environment, we choose R and CARET package due to simplicity and access to the most recent machine learning methods.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel course assessment process supported by a Web based interface that articulates and streamlines the assessment data collection, performance evaluation and tracking of remedial recommendations. To close the assessment loop, the Web interface provides also a mechanism to follow up on the implementation of remedial recommendations and analyzes their associated reflective actions during the subsequent course assessment cycle.

In this paper we describe two basic design considerations for the development of such learning environments: the analysis of the learner special educational needs and the analysis of the learning content characteristics, both in a formal and reusable way. We present how learner and content modeling is carried out in accordance to the international standardization efforts, in respect to the special educational needs of sensitive learner communities. We discuss these issues in the context of the NEMO project, and we present our analysis results for a learning group belonging in the wider community of people with cognitive disabilities.",

Additionally, the continuous growth of mobile devices' ownership, as well as their increased technical capabilities, have created an emerging trend for supporting mobile access to virtual and remote labs. Existing approaches in this direction are focusing on developing device-dependent mobile apps for accessing the experiment(s) of the original remote or virtual lab. This creates difficulties related to (a) seamless access to experiments of remote or virtual labs across various mobile devices and (b) additional costs that are needed for developing different versions of the same mobile app that meets the specific technical requirements of each mobile device.

XML elements are treated either as classes or attributes based on their complexity, without loosing the relative order of elements in the original document. Furthermore, this chapter describes the extension of the system's deductive rule query language with second-order variables, general path and ordering expressions, for querying over the stored, tree-structured XML data and constructing XML documents as a result. The extensions were implemented by translating all the extended features into the basic, first-order deductive rule language of Device using meta-data about stored XML objects.",

Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards web-based educational systems tailored to specific pedagogical approaches. As a response to pedagogical concerns towards standardization and interoperability needs, Educational Modeling Languages (EMLs) were introduced. These languages attempt to provide a formal way of representing the educational process in a commonly agreed manner. Nevertheless, still there exist very few web-based educational systems that support EMLs. One of the key issues to be considered when designing web-based educational systems to support EML is the adoption of easy-to-use tools for the definition of learning scenarios.

However, despite this encouraging evidence, research on the explicit benefits of the FCM on K-12 Mathematics education is still scarce and, in some cases, even inconclusive. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to present an action research for investigating the impact of FCM in K-12 Math (Algebra) teaching and learning in order to support and extend the narrow existing pool of works. The action research was based on a quasi-experimental design (using an experimental-control group protocol), with a sample of 40 students, for a full semester of the school year. The results provide evidence for potential advantages in students\u2019 cognitive learning outcomes (on knowledge of subject domain), students\u2019 level of motivation, as well as better use of teaching time during the face-to-face school-based sessions.",

However, although a number of such systems have been designed to meet accessibility needs and preferences for those groups, most of them anticipate special-purpose e-training material and keep their e-training activities local to the particular system in use. As a result, neither reuse of existing digital training resources (widely available nowadays in web-based repositories) nor sharing of best technology-facilitated training practices among the communities of educational practitioners and training organizations is supported by these systems.

            "Abstract": "During the last decade, Open Educational Resources (OERs) have gained increased attention for their potential to support open access, sharing and reuse of digital educational resources. Therefore, a large amount of digital educational resources have become available worldwide through web-based open access repositories which are referred to as Learning Object Repositories (LORs). These resources have the potential to facilitate teachers to improve and enhance their day-to-day teaching activities. On the other hand, it has been identified that teachers could benefit from their participation in communities of best teaching practices by sharing, not only educational resources, but also learning designs that represent their pedagogical approach. As a result, there is an increased interest for the development of web-based repositories that facilitate open access to both educational resources and learning designs. However, the process of developing and sharing learning designs through web-based repositories requires authoring tools that can represent learning designs in a machine-readable way. A commonly accepted way that provides a standard notation language for the description of learning designs is the IMS Learning Design (LD) Specification. Consequently, a number of IMS LD compatible learning design authoring tools has already been developed. Nevertheless, most of these tools (a) are not supporting the process of importing and editing learning designs and (b) they are stand-alone tools restricting their widespread use. To this end, in this paper we present a web-based learning design authoring tool that aims to overcome the \u2026",

As a result, a key open challenge is to design and implement recommender systems that support science teachers in finding and selecting appropriate RVLs based on core pedagogical elements of their learning designs and their own information and communication technology (ICT)-supported teaching competence profiles. In response to this challenge, we propose a recommender system for supporting learning design driven RVLs recommendations taking into consideration teachers\u2019 profiling elements related to the ICT-supported teaching competences for using RVLs.

However, despite the importance of school leadership, the definition of this concept has been perceived from diverse standpoints, leading to a multitude of different school leadership models. On the other hand, as the role of school leaders is enhanced, the competences that the school leaders need to attain and demonstrate are also continuously updated. In this shifting context, this chapter aims to shed light on the contemporary understanding of K-12 school leadership models and competence frameworks through a systematic analysis in international scholarly and educational policy literature and the proposal of a school leadership competence \u201cmeta-framework,\u201d as a synthesis of the up-to-date school leader \u2026",

Despite the large investments being placed on Smart City infrastructure, however, there is still very scarce attention on the new learning approaches that will be needed for cultivating Digital Smart Citizenship competences, namely the competences which will be needed by the citizens and workforce of such cities for exploiting the digital technologies in creative and innovative ways for driving financial and societal sustainability. In this context, this paper introduces cyberphysical learning as an overarching model of cultivating Digital Smart Citizenship competences by exploiting the potential of Internet of Things technologies and social media, in order to create authentic blended and augmented learning experiences.",

Users\u2019 perceptions of mobile learning (m-learning) technologies are of great importance and precede the successful integration of these technologies in education. M-learning adoption has been investigated in the literature with reference to various factors and learning analytics, but largely without considering the role of different configurations (i.e., specific combinations of variables), and how these configurations might affect the adoption of various user groups. For instance, users with different backgrounds, experiences, learning styles, and so on might not be represented by the one-model-fits-all produced from the common regression approaches.

These initiatives have contributed in building and sustaining web-based repositories which are called learning object repositories (LORs). However, with many LORs implemented and maintained independently, valuable LOs are scattered over different LORs and it might be difficult for end users to easily access them. A suggested solution towards addressing this issue is to create infrastructures that enable the discovery and identification of LOs across different LORs. As a result, several federated infrastructures have been developed and are currently operating online. Within this context, a prominent European initiative has been \u2026",

Indeed, the recent growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) has greatly increased the amount of information and educational resources available to the education community.The full exploitation of this mass body of knowledge resources available on the Web, can be, however, compromised, by the difficulty in describing, classifying and maintaining those resources in such a way that they can be retrieved in an \u201ceducationally efficient and effective way\u201d. Today, the web community has embraced the collection and use of metadata to characterise and index educational resources, which lead to semantically more accurate retrieval of information than search engines. In general sense, metadata is information about data. In the context of resource discovery, descriptive metadata is a characterisation that aims to represent the intellectual content of the resource. The most popular technology for representing metadata is XML (eXtensible Markup Language).",

However, the design and development of Web-based learning environments for people with special abilities has been addressed so far by the development of hypermedia and multimedia based educational content that is specially designed for the user targeted group, as well as the use of dedicated infrastructure supporting the delivery of learning content.

However, although a number of e-training systems are designed to meet accessibility needs and preferences for those groups, most of them anticipate special-purpose training material and keep their training activities local to the system. As a result, neither reuse of existing digital educational resources (widely available nowadays in web-based repositories) nor sharing of best technology-facilitated training practices among the communities of educational practitioners and training organizations, is supported by these systems.

Technology holds the potential to facilitate assessment implementation and maximize the benefits for all involved stakeholders. Cases of technology-enabled assessment are traced back to the use of the abacus and writing techniques for evaluating knowledge acquisition more than 2000 years ago. However, the use of technology alone, without being followed by the necessary paradigm shifts, cannot result to a significant effect in learning and teaching. The sometimes divergent evidence reported indicate the need for re-conceptualizing the ways in which technology should support both learning and assessment. Today, typically, learners and teachers use technology for accessing learning resources or submitting assigned homework, whereas technology has the potential to facilitate engagement in meaningful and authentic learning experiences and methods of keeping track of their levels of achievement. Technology is a vehicle that has the potential to help toward effectively meeting learning and assessment needs. However, this potential cannot be realized without taking account of the fact that learning and consequently assessment takes place within the context (both social and technological) in which the learner \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The possible exploitation of 3D Virtual Worlds (VW) remains a major challenge for school teachers, since 3D VWs introduce new concepts that even teachers who are experienced and keen on using digital technologies are not familiar with. To this end, there are research studies that have raised issues, such as, the extra pressure applied to teachers who teach within 3D VWs, and the lack of understanding of the new possibilities offered by 3D VWs in teaching and learning. Within this context, in this study we present a 3D Virtual Classroom Simulation appropriately designed and implemented using SLOODLE for supporting a module for teachers' continuing professional development based on the Synectics \"Making the strange familiar\" instructional strategy, that aim towards acquiring appropriate competences for teaching and for developing innovative educational practices within 3D VWs.",

            "Abstract": "Over the past years, several Open Educational Resources (OERs) initiatives have been emerged worldwide aiming to create, share and reuse digital educational resources among educational communities. As a result, organizing, offering and accessing these resources over the web have been key issues for both the research and the educational community. Traditionally, a popular way for characterizing digital educational resources is by using a formal and centrally agreed classification system, such as the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (LOM). On the other hand, with the emerging Web 2.0 applications, the issue of characterizing digital educational resources tends to move from the expert-based description based on formal classification systems to a less formal user-based tagging referred to as social tagging. As a result, a number of studies have been reported in the field of Technology-enhanced Learning (TeL) aiming to evaluate whether social tagging can improve the discovery of new digital educational resources and the retrieval of known ones stored in web-based repositories. Additionally, recent studies in the field of social tagging systems has provided initial evidence that users\u2019 tagging motivation has a direct influence on the properties of the resulted tags and folksonomies. Thus, in this paper we aim to propose a methodology for investigating this issue and examine whether different end-users\u2019 tagging motivations (that is teachers) could enlarge the metadata descriptions of digital educational resources. The results of our study provided us evidence that there is a direct influence of users\u2019 tagging motivation on the enlargement of \u2026",

To effectively engage students in Inquiry tasks, appropriate guidance should be provided, usually by combining digital tools such online labs and modeling tools. This is a cumbersome task for teachers, since it involves manually assessing the type/level of tool-supported guidance to be provided and potentially refining these to meet guidance needs of individual students. In our research we target to investigate how to support this systematic reflection process with educational data analytics methods and tools from both the design and the delivery of Inquiry-based educational designs (IED).

However, most of the existing approaches focus on the learners' perspective and do not take into consideration teachers' profile. Moreover, the systems that do target teachers, do not explicitly exploit their ICT competence profiles. This can lead to recommending LOs that are beyond the teachers' current ability to use in their teaching practice. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem and propose, as a first step, a set of mapping rules for aligning teachers' ICT competences and LO metadata elements. Moreover, a preliminary simulated evaluation is described, the results of which indicate that the mapping schema can provide robust identification of appropriate LOs based on both the users' ICT competences and the overall ratings of the \u2026",

A number of international initiatives have recently emerged and recognized the importance of sharing and reusing digital educational resources among educational communities worldwide. As a result, organizing, managing, offering, and accessing these resources over the Web have been key issues for both the research and the educational community. Within this framework, a popular way for describing digital educational resources is by using a formal and centrally agreed classification system, such as the IEEE Learning Objects Metadata (LOM). The emerging Web 2.0 applications have increased the amount of user-generated educational resources on the Web.

The World Wide Web has considerable potential to expand and improve PjBL environments. However, making implicit aspects of a programming task accessible to learners and instructors to support reflection and improvement can be challenging. This paper discusses the challenge of PjBL in programming education and outlines a set of key aspects and an analysis framework to inform design and analysis of PjBL programming in web-based environments, by exploiting the emerging field of Teaching and Learning Analytics. Based on the proposed analysis framework, the design of an empirical study is outlined, capitalizing on a novel web-based PjBL environment that \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Project-based learning (PjBL) has been widely promoted in educational practice, for example, computer programming education. While PiBL may help learners to connect abstract knowledge with authentic practice, the complexity of completing an authentic project may overwhelm learners, making them unable to achieve the desired learning outcomes. This study proposes a visualisation-based and progressive learning environment as a cognitive tool to support PjBL of programming. The cognitive tool is designed to externalise the complex process of completing a realistic programming project. It aims to scaffold the complex project process, foster effective thinking and reflection, and allow the teacher to track and give feedback on individual performance throughout the project process. Moreover, simple-to-complex sequencing of whole-task projects is incorporated into the cognitive tool to support progressive learning with authentic projects. Senior college students participated in this study by completing a project-based programming learning module using the proposed cognitive tool. The results showed that after incorporating the simple-to-complex approach, the visualisation-based cognitive tool is more effective in improving students\u2019 programming performance and better perceived by students in terms of its support for scaffolding and articulating the complex project process.",

There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agent systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. Main tracks have been identified. However innovative contributions that do not easily fit into these areas will also be considered as long as they are directly related to the overall theme of the conference--cognition and exploratory learning in the digital age. The CELDA 2018 Conference received 85 submissions from more than 31 countries. Each submission was reviewed in a double-blind review process by at least two independent reviewers to ensure quality and maintain high standards. Out of the papers submitted, 37 were accepted as full papers, 20 were accepted as short papers, and 5 were accepted as reflection papers. In addition to the \u2026",

This work proposes a framework for supporting Self-regulation in Seamless Learning scenarios. The framework is based on the Endsley's Model for Situation Awareness. Moreover, the framework is contextualised to a specific class of learning scenarios in order to better explain its potentiality. In particular, the framework allows to define a Decision Support System which exploits the recognized situations for supporting learners in self-regulating their learning processes. Situation Theory is adopted to provide a formal model describing the whole learning situation of the learner. Lastly, a set of algorithms and semantic techniques are proposed to support the above mentioned automatic recognition.",

As a result, application profiles aim to facilitate the application-oriented implementation of educational metadata specifications. In this paper we discuss the issue of standardization vs. conversion and will present different existing specifications with the relative merits of each one, we will examine the fundamental techniques for the definition of application profiles and will focus on discussing interoperability issues in the case of application profiles.

Therefore, many educational institutions and scientific organizations have invested efforts for providing online access to state-of-the-art science experiments via RVLs. Currently, there are existing initiatives for the storage and organization of existing RVLs into web-based repositories towards increasing their findability and enabling science teachers to search and retrieve them for further usage into their lesson plans. Nevertheless, most of these repositories adopt metadata models that store limited information related to the pedagogical context of their lesson plans. As a result, science teachers are not supported in selecting RVLs taking into consideration core elements of their lesson planning. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem by proposing the ASK4Labs a web-based repository for supporting learning design driven RVLs recommendations. Preliminary evaluation results are also described, which indicate that the proposed recommender system can provide robust identification of appropriate RVLs based on the pedagogical context elements of the intended lesson plans.",

            "Abstract": "Worldwide, a vast amount of educational content is constantly being produced, in order to support learning and teaching, in a wide range of contexts such as school, academic, training or lifelong learning. The rapid increase in the quantity of available learning objects makes it difficult to search or reuse them by adopting or integrating them into new educa-tional contexts. This problem can be handled efficiently by using learning object metadata. With consistent descriptions of the learning objects characteristics, searching becomes more specific and in-depth; managing becomes simpler and uniform; and sharing becomes more efficient and accurate.",

A suggested solution towards addressing this issue is to create federated LORs, which aim to harvest and aggregate LOs' metadata from different LORs towards facilitating LOs' discovery across these LORs through a single infrastructure. However, a challenging issue during the development of federated LORs is the design of appropriate metadata application profile (AP) which supports harvesting heterogeneous metadata records from the aggregated LORs.

Therefore, there are increased efforts worldwide for the design of teachers\u2019 professional development programmes that aim to enhance teachers\u2019 competences for the use of ICT in school education. However, these programmes are mainly designed to address ICT competences that are based on different teachers\u2019 ICT competence frameworks that have been recently developed. Although these competence frameworks aim to tackle the same problem, the diversity in their approaches leads to heterogeneous competence descriptions that cannot be formally described and represented in a unified manner among different European Union Member States.

This problem has been identified by the research and the educational community. To this end, there are research studies that have raised issues, such as, the extra pressure applied to teachers who teach within 3D Virtual Worlds, and the lack of understanding for the new opportunities offered by 3D Virtual Worlds in teaching and learning.

In spite of the fact that most of these rules are generic (ie, domain independent), there are no well-defined and commonly accepted rules on how the learning objects should be selected and how they should be sequenced to make \u201cinstructional sense.\u201d Moreover, in order to design adaptive learning systems, a huge set of rules is required, since dependencies between educational characteristics of learning objects and learners are rather complex.

We engage parameters of the learner\u2019s cognitive style and create a multi-criteria utility model that evaluates available didactic methods, using initial evaluations upon a set of basic cognitive categories. The proposed methodology is studied within the context of the European KOD project, where intelligent agents providing educational e-content brokerage services to the learners, require methods and tools to dynamically assess the suitability of the available educational resources.",

            "Abstract": "Schools have not fully exploited the potential of ICT despite the several initiatives addressing that issue. The reasons for this are manifold due to the complex nature of schools as organizations. Therefore, there is an essential need for a method to effectively capture the level of each factor's contribution to the overall schools' ICT uptake. Towards that end, a review of the existing eMaturity approaches to measuring ICT uptake in schools is performed and the results are used to evaluate whether this concept can adequately meet the above requirements. This leads to the proposal for a new framework for profiling schools' ICT competences, which incorporates currently excluded organizational competence dimensions. This could facilitate the identification of specific factors influencing school competence level and, thus, assisting in more informed corrective action planning.",

Most of the existing approaches, however, aim at accommodating the needs of learners and teacher-oriented RS are still an under-investigated field. Moreover, the systems that focus on teachers, do not explicitly exploit their ICT competence profiles when providing LO recommendations. This is a significant drawback, since it can result in LO recommendations that are beyond the teachers' competence to use. Towards tackling this issue, this paper extends previous work and proposes a teacher ICT Competence-based RS that considers teachers' ICT Competence Profiles when recommending Learning Objects. Moreover, the results of its accuracy evaluation are presented. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides high predictive accuracy and outperforms commonly used, existing RS approaches.",

With respect to the need for promoting educational reforms, technology can play a catalytic role by providing unique opportunities for creating effective learning environments. Digital games constitute an example of a technological facilitator that can be exploited for the design and implementation of pedagogical innovations. Existing research provides evidence for the effectiveness of digital games with respect to achieving subject-speci\ufb01c learning objectives. However, there are relatively few efforts concerned with the investigation of their impact on the development of higher-order cognitive skills, as well as emotional and motivational outcomes. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate game-based assessment methods makes imperative the need for further research that will allow for establishing evidence-based conclusions about the learning effectiveness of digital games. Within this context, the aim of this book chapter is to provide an overview of research issues related to digital game-based learning with an emphasis on its application in formal education settings identifying differences between school and higher education.",

On the other hand, the paradigm of learning objects retains, to a large extent, its initial anticipations and, supported by educational metadata, it is still influencing technology-enhanced learning system design. Nevertheless, the IEEE LOM Specification does not directly support the description of learning resources in terms of their relevance to competence-based learning programmes. In this paper we target addressing this problem, that is, we identify and study the main issues related to the competence-relevant characteristics of learning resources and propose an IEEE LOM competence application profile that can be used for tagging educational resources \u2026",

Nevertheless, there are no commonly accepted and appropriately designed models for representing LPs. This shortcoming is also mirrored in the existing LP authoring tools, with each of them accommodating a different subset of the overall LP elements. To address this issue, we have proposed an educational Design-driven LP Representation Metadata Model (LPRM) which (a) comprises and extends a range of existing dimensions to model LPs and (b) is structured based on the ADDIE Educational Design Model. Capitalizing on this, the contribution of this chapter is the critical evaluation of a set of widely used LP authoring tools in terms of the level of accommodation they offer for the elements of the proposed LPRM.

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, there is a consensus that inquiry-based learning contributes to developing students\u2019 scientific literacy in schools. Inquiry-based teaching strategies are promoted for the development (among others) of the cognitive processes that cultivate problem solving (PS) competence. The build up of PS competence is a central objective for most compulsory education (K-12) curricula and a critical competence for both professional career readiness and effective citizenship. A widely accepted framework for assessing individual students\u2019 PS competence at large scale is PISA 2012 Problem Solving Framework (PSF). Nevertheless, PISA 2012 PS competence assessment is primarily summative (one-off assessment) and disconnected from the daily school science teaching practice. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to address this issue by proposing a framework for incorporating assessment tasks of PISA 2012 PSF to the various phases of an inquiry teaching model. This framework sets the ground for supporting domain specific assessment of students\u2019 problem solving competence during day-to-day school science teaching practice.",

Typically, these initiatives focus on collecting digital educational resources that are offered by their creators for open access and potential reuse. Nevertheless, most of the existing LORs are designed more as digital repositories, rather than as Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). By exploiting KMSs functionalities in LORs would bare the potential to support the organization and sharing of educational communities\u2019 explicit knowledge (depicted in digital educational resources constructed by teachers and/or instructional designers) and tacit knowledge (depicted in teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 experiences and interactions of using digital educational resources available in LORs). Within this context, in this paper we study the design and the implementation of fourteen operating LORs from the KMSs\u2019 perspective, so as to identify additional functionalities that can support the management of educational communities\u2019 explicit and tacit knowledge. Thus, we propose a list of essential LORs\u2019 functionalities, which aim to facilitate the organization and sharing of educational communities\u2019 knowledge. Finally, we present the added value of these functionalities by identifying their importance towards addressing the current demands of web-facilitated educational communities, as well as the knowledge management activities that they execute.",

Designing STEM lessons supported by specific OLs is a challenging task and thus, it is useful for STEM teachers to be able to share their lesson plans in a way that these can be effectively searched by others. The most common way to facilitate this process is (a) to characterize the lesson plans with appropriately selected educational metadata and (b) to build a web repository that collects the metadata records of the lesson plans (following a common metadata schema) and offers search and retrieval functionalities. In our previous work, a metadata schema that can be used for characterizing STEM lesson plans supported by OLs has been proposed. The scope of this paper is to complement the findings of our \u2026",

In particular, memory-based collaborative filtering (CF) approaches have demonstrated promising results for real-life implementations of web-based Learning Object Repositories (LOR). Building on this, the contribution of this paper is an enhancement to existing memory-based CF RS methods, by adaptively selecting the teacher neighbors based on their co-rated LOs and the attribute similarity of the latter to the LO to be recommended. The evaluation results show a significant increase in the predictive accuracy of the adaptive RS approaches compared to their \"traditional\" benchmarks, signifying the proposed approach's capacity to enhance the accuracy of existing memory-based CF approaches.",

This is the result of DL being associated to core competences of the current and future workplaces such as problem-solving, critical thinking, self-regulated learning, and effective collaboration, which are considered as essential for building innovative solutions to wicked global challenges. However, despite this well-acknowledged trend research related to modeling, cultivating and assessing Deeper Learning competences is still at a shaping stage. This is also reflected in the rather limited advancements in the use of digital educational technologies to support the assessment and measurement of DL. In this context, the contribution of this chapter is to perform a systematic literature \u2026",

However, although a number of systems that claim to meet accessibility needs and preferences are proposed, most of them are typically supported by hypermedia and multimedia educational content that is specially designed for the user targeted group. Such approaches prevent their user groups (both learners and their tutors) from accessing other available resources. Therefore, it is important to be able to built generic e-learning systems that would allow the reuse of existing learning resources in different accessibility demanding applications. To this end, in this article we propose a methodology for defining an accessibility application profile that captures the accessibility properties of learning objects in a standard form and we examine its application to the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education has been recognized as a top priority for school education worldwide [1]. The focal points of STEM education posit the standpoint that student-centred teaching approaches should be exploited for cultivating (among others) students\u2019 critical thinking, inquiry and problem solving competences, reasoning and creativity abilities, as well as exploiting these competences in the context of addressing real-world problems and phenomena [2]. In addition, innovative blended-teaching models, such as the Flipped Classroom (FC) model, are being increasingly deployed to enhance student-centred teaching approaches in order to optimize the use of face-to-face teaching time for cultivating the aforementioned student competences ([3],[4]).In this context, and considering the novelty of the FC model, teachers (especially novices) could benefit from having access to teaching model templates for supporting the design of FC-enhanced STEM lesson and educational scenarios plans. More specifically, towards facilitating STEM teachers, such blended-teaching templates should i) provide a structured,\u201cgeneric\u201d framework for authoring teaching, learning and assessment activities within the specific phases of \u201cSTEM-appropriate\u201d teaching models and ii) incorporate the standpoints of the FC Model in terms teaching, learning and assessment activities distribution between the teacherled face-to-face classroom and/or lab-based sessions and the student-led \u201chomework\u201d sessions.

However, despite this encouraging body of research, the subject domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) teaching at K-12 education has not yet been explicitly researched. This is a considerable shortcoming given (a) the globally acknowledged need to effectively design and deliver ICT curricula to students at all levels of school education (primary, junior and senior secondary) towards cultivation of digital competences, and (b) the recurring research evidence that the Flipped Classroom approach can enhance students\u2019 learning experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) K-12 education.

To support the provision of competence-based learning services, it is necessary to maintain a record of an individual's competences in a persistent and standard way. In this paper, we investigate the problem of defining a common metadata model for the description of competencies based on the application of the current state-of-the-art specification (namely, the IMS RDCEO) in describing competencies, in a real case study, that is, the EuroPass Language Passport. To this end, we identify four open issues on the description capabilities of the IMS RDCEO specification, and propose possible extensions to its information model, demonstrating their application in practice",

Within this context, over the past years a number of international efforts have led to the development of the IEEE LOM standard as a commonly accepted way for describing educational resources with metadata, facilitating storage, search and retrieval of these resources through web-based repositories. In response to this increased interest, a number of software tools have been developed, so as to facilitate educational metadata authoring of educational resources.

On the other hand, the paradigm of Learning Objects retains, to a large extent, its initial anticipations and supported by Educational Metadata, it is still influencing Technology-Enhanced Learning system design. Nevertheless, the IEEE LOM standard does not directly support the description of learning resources in terms of their relevance to accessibility and/or competence-based learning programmes. In this paper we target addressing this problem, that is, we identify and study the main issues related to the accessibility and competence relevant characteristics of learning resources and propose an IEEE LOM Application Profile that can be used for tagging learning resources in an accessible and competence meaningful manner.",

Although MOOCs are widely discussed as potential alternatives to traditional university courses, still there are several challenges for their pedagogically effective design. More specifically, MOOCs are facing the challenge of designing learner-centered online courses for the masses, rather than just providing open access to static educational resources. Thus, MOOCs\u2019 design involves, among others, the pedagogically meaningful and effective handling of massive numbers of people and of massive volumes of educational resources. On the other hand, research in the educational exploitation of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) may provide valuable insights on issues such as engagement, commitment, learner connectedness, and the distributed resources.

These benefits are typically accounted to the pedagogically efficient use of classroom time for engaging students in active learning. Although there are several relevant studies for the deployment of the FC model in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects, and at Higher Education and/or High School, there are very few works studying FC in social studies and at primary school level. This paper presents an action research focused on the implementation of the FC model in teaching social studies in primary school.

Recently metadata are widely used to semantically describe educational resources and a number of educational metadata specifications have been proposed aiming at defining the set of elements that can better describe an educational resource. This paper proposes an architecture for an educational metadata management system, which facilitates both metadata storage and data retrieval, by using a deductive object-oriented database. The proposed system provides not only tools for creation, validation and modification of educational metadata documents, but also an efficient information retrieval mechanism based on user queries.",

On the other hand, the paradigm of Learning Objects-as a way to organize, manage, offer and use digital learning resources-retains, to a large extent, its initial anticipations and, supported by Educational Metadata, it is still influencing Technology-Enhanced Learning system design. However, there not exist yet, a commonly accepted proposal for metadata that could describe competence-related characteristics of educational resources that support Lifelong Competence Development Programmes. In this paper we target addressing this issue, that is, we identify and study the main issues related to the competence-relevant \u2026",

The proposed method consists of two stages acting complementarily. In the first, better estimates of the reconstructed DCT coefficients are obtained based on their observed probability distribution. In the second, an efficient postprocessing scheme, consisting of a region classification algorithm and spatial adaptive filtering, is applied. Experimental results illustrating the performance of the proposed method are presented and evaluated.",

            "Abstract": "Within the context of the emerging Open Academic Courses Initiatives, the issue of explicitly describing an academic course is raised. Nevertheless, existing Initiatives do not share a common conceptual model for describing their academic courses. The main drawback of this approach is that these descriptions impede inter initiative comparison and exploitation of academic courses by students and course tutors. The Course Description Metadata (CDM) specification has been proposed as a way to describe academic courses in a common format. Within the context of European Higher Education, CDM specification has been influenced by the European Credit Transfer Accumulation System (ECTS). As a result, an application profile of the CDM specification has been developed referred to as CDM-ECTS. Despite these efforts, it appears that there are not software tools that allow authoring of academic courses \u2026",

To make search and retrieval of science education digital content more efficient it is important to ensure that appropriate (in terms of quality and quantity) educational metadata are attached to them. Thus, in this paper we propose an IEEE LOM Science Education Application Profile that can be used for tagging science education resources with science curriculum related characteristics and we demonstrate an educational metadata authoring toolkit, which supports the proposed IEEE LOM Application Profile.",

With respect to the need for promoting educational reforms, technology can play a catalytic role by providing unique opportunities for creating effective learning environments. Digital games constitute an example of a technological facilitator that can be exploited for the design and implementation of pedagogical innovations. Existing research provides evidence for the effectiveness of digital games with respect to achieving subject-specific learning objectives. However, there are relatively few efforts concerned with the investigation of their impact on the development of higher-order cognitive skills, as well as emotional and motivational outcomes. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate game-based assessment methods makes imperative the need for further \u2026",

However, specific barriers (mainly related to teachers\u2019 data literacy competences), can defer teachers from engaging with inquiry to improve their teaching practice. To alleviate these barriers and support teacher inquiry, the concept of Teaching and Learning Analytics (TLA) has been proposed, as a complementing synergy between Teaching Analytics and Learning Analytics. Teaching and Learning Analytics aims to provide a framework in which the insights generated by Learning Analytics methods and tools can become meaningfully translated for driving teachers\u2019 inquiry to improve their teaching practice, captured through Teaching Analytics methods and tools. In this context, TLA have been identified as a research challenge with significant practical impact \u2026",
