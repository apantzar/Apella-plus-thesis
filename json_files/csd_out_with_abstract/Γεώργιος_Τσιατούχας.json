Certain performance-affecting circuit elements are designed to be digitally controllable, providing the capability to adjust the performance characteristics of a circuit\u2019s instance around their post-fabrication values, throughout a set of discrete states of operation. The alternate test methodology is adopted for test and calibration and a set of optimally selected test observables is used to develop regression models for the prediction of the circuit\u2019s performance characteristics in every state of operation. In the test phase, measurements of the test observables are obtained from a subset of the circuit\u2019s states. The processing of these observables provides accurate prediction of the RF circuit\u2019s performance characteristics in all available states and enables the discrimination of defect-free from defective circuits.

The use of dynamic circuit design techniques can provide high speed operation at lower silicon area requirements, compared to full static CMOS designs. Another common design technique in order to achieve high operating speed is the use of pipeline schemes. However, the higher the required operating frequency, the higher the number of stages we must implement in the pipeline. In addition, a limiting factor in cases with a large number of stages, are the restrictions imposed from the required memory elements. These memory elements not only increase the silicon area of the implementation but also restrict the maximum achievable frequency due to their internal delays. In this paper, we propose a memory-less pipeline design style, where the combinational part is implemented with dynamic circuits that offer the desirable high speed operation \u2026",

The proposed method reduces test cost and obviates additional manufacturing steps for post-silicon repair. In addition to eliminating the need for an external tester, it offers protection against latent defects that are manifested as errors in the field. In this way, the robust BIST/BISR solution for power switches enhances the reliability of multi-core chips that employ aggressive power management techniques.

Feasibility of alternate tests may be compromised if the pertinent models that are used for the prediction of a circuit's performance are of poor accuracy. To construct accurate models across the whole design space, a large set of real data needs ideally to be collected from different wafers and lots over a long period of time, that is not possible in the early production stage. In this paper we show that, even when small training sets are available, alternate test accuracy can be significantly improved if the training set is statistically treated in a weighted fashion.

In particular, resistive open defects turn to be a major concern in DRAMs. Our analysis and simulation results show that an important phenomenon exists, charge accumulation, which is currently not considered in DRAM testing. Charge accumulation occurs in DRAM cells that suffer from internal resistive opens; a weak value stored at a cell is strengthened when a sequence of read operations is applied to it. Typical DRAM testing procedures (like March tests) fail to provide enhanced coverage of resistive open defects, since they do not consider charge accumulation. This paper provides an effective test algorithm that targets resistive open defects, while considering the bit-line imbalance and the charge accumulation mechanisms.",

Among the dominant solutions proposed, in the open literature, to overcome this problem is the technique of internal nodes multiple precharging. However the added precharge transistors are not testable for stuck-open and stuck-on faults. Undetectable stuck-open faults on these transistors cause reduction of the noise margins of the gate.

            "Abstract": "As dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) are becoming denser with technology scaling, more complex fault behaviors emerge; examples are leakage, coupling effects, and cell neighborhoods interaction. The neighborhood pattern sensitive fault (NPSF) model is suitable to address such faulty behaviors and identify them during the characterization and/or test of new DRAM chips. However, NPSF test algorithms are extremely time-consuming and therefore not economically affordable. In this brief, we show how layout information can be used to refine and significantly simplify the NPSF model and reduce the test time complexity. As a case study, the folded DRAM array is considered. A realistic NPSF model, the \u0394-type neighborhood, is introduced together with a time efficient test algorithm which is more than two-times cheaper than traditional ones. Even when incorporating bit-line influence and word-line \u2026",

An inherent problem of Domino logic is that under specific input conditions the charge redistribution between parasitic capacitances at internal nodes of a circuit can violate the noise margins and cause erroneous responses at the output. The dominant solution to this problem is the multiple precharging of the gate's internal nodes. However, the added precharge transistors are not testable for stuck-open faults. Undetectable stuck-open faults at these transistors may cause noise margins reduction and consequently may affect the reliability of the circuit since its operation in the field will be sensitive to environmental factors such as noise.

            "Abstract": "Dynamic logic families have been shown to offer performance advantages over traditional CMOS logic. Their operation is based on the use of a clock signal that provides two operation phases: the precharge phase and evaluation phase. The precharge phase is setting the circuit at a predefined initial state while the actual logic response is determined during the evaluation phase. In this paper we examine potential advantages when an additional phase, called pre-evaluation, is introduced. During this phase a restricted voltage swing occurs depending on the desired outcome. This voltage swing is amplified during the final evaluation in order to produce the final logic response. By restricting the required voltage swing at internal logic nodes (especially in case of those presenting high capacitance) we are able to achieve higher performance coupled with reduced power consumption.",

Alternate tests provide a cost- and time-effective substitute for their conventional specification-based counterparts by attempting to predict rather than directly measuring a circuit's performance from its response to suitable test stimuli. In order to provide post-manufacture yield recovery through calibration, integrated RF circuits-especially nanometric circuits-are often designed to present some form of adjustability. Such a property offers a set of discrete states of operation, from which a performance-compliant state is selected by calibration. In general, an alternate test can be conducted for each discrete state of operation, thus providing a large set of test observables from which regression models can be constructed to predict performance in all available states. However, test time and cost concerns impose \u2026",

These memory elements increase the area overhead and restrict the maximum achievable frequency due to their delays. Memory-less pipelines based on dynamic design address these issues but, still require high power consumption for the clock signal.

We provide an improvement of this technique by first detecting dense graphs in the interconnection graph and then placing cells that belong to denser graphs closer to the center of the spiral. By doing so we reduce the wirelength required for routing. Routing is performed by a variation of the maze algorithm enhanced by a set of heuristics that have been tuned to maximize performance.

According to a common alternate test approach, RF mixer calibration is based on the prediction of the circuit's performance characteristics that requires the acquisition of a set of DC voltage observables obtained from specific nodes of the mixer operating in homodyne mode. These observables, however, often correspond to internal nodes where direct access is not always possible. Furthermore, accurate calibration might require a relatively large set of voltage observables whose direct access would lead to a waste of resources and to increased cost. The proposed built-in technique provides digital readings for the DC levels at all nodes of interest through a single interface by exploiting the use of a voltage acquisition circuit implemented by a simple analog to digital converter \u2026",

The circuit has been designed in a 0.18-mum triple-well standard CMOS technology, using double-gate-oxide-thickness MOS transistors with an absolute maximum rating of 4.0 V, a nominal power supply of 1.8 V, and a required negative voltage of -3.3 V. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed topology. According to the results, 1.82-ns delay and 0.53-mW power consumption are reported",
