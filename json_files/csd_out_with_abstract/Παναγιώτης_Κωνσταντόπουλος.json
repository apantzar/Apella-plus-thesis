            "Abstract": "Digital material is vulnerable to loss and corruption as it is stored in magnetic and optical media that can fail because of exposure to heat, humidity, airborne contaminants or because of faulty reading and writing devices. Organizations whose mission encompasses the preservation of information and cultural heritage have very high reliability requirements for their digital preservation systems. The problem essentially is to achieve given reliability goals with minimal cost. In an on-going project we study the effectiveness of various system configurations for digital preservation by applying analytical modelling techniques to evaluate the reliability of those configurations. The results are expected to be useful in supporting such decisions as how many copies to retain for each document, how frequently to check these copies for corruptions, what storage schemes are most effective for data preservation, what strategies are most effective for error recovery and repair, how many sites should be used in order to prevent loss from natural disasters such as flood, fire, earthquake. Our work includes sensitivity analysis of a set of reliability criteria with respect to model parameters in representative cases. This can prove especially helpful in identifying dominant factors with respect to the reliability and cost of each configuration. Preliminary results exhibit a certain degree of counter-intuitiveness, which adds value to the model. In this paper we present the main points of the model and outline some policies suggested by the analysis so far.",

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of Web, database and social networking technologies has enabled us to produce, publish and exchange digital assets at an enormous rate. This vast amount of information that is either digitized or born-digital needs to be collected, organized and preserved in a way that ensures that our digital assets and the information they carry remain available for future use. Digital curation has emerged as a new inter-disciplinary practice that seeks to set guidelines for disciplined management of information. In this paper we review two recent models for digital curation introduced by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) of UK and the Digital Curation Unit (DCU) of the Athena Research Centre. We then propose a fusion of the two models that highlights the need to extend the digital curation lifecycle by adding (a) provisions for the registration of usage experience,(b) a stage for knowledge enhancement and (c) controlled vocabularies used by convention to denote concepts, properties and relations. The objective of the proposed extensions is twofold:(i) to provide a more complete lifecycle model for the digital curation domain; and (ii) to provide a stimulus for a broader discussion on the research agenda.",

Semantically, query patterns represent important questions, while syntactically they impose the correct formulation of queries. In this paper we address the development of query patterns at successive representation layers so as to expose dominant information requirements on one hand, and structures that can support effective user interaction and efficient implementation of query processing on the other. An empirical study for the domain of cultural heritage reveals an initial set of recurrent questions, which are then reduced to a modestly sized set of query patterns. A set of Datalog rules is developed in order to formally define these patterns which are also expressed as SPARQL queries.",

We assume that these objects belong to an underlying domain that is common to all sources (e.g. a set of Web pages of interest), and that different sources may use different ontologies with terms that correspond to different natural languages or to different levels of granularity. Information integration is obtained through a mediator comprising two parts: (a) an ontology, and (b) a set of articulations to the sources.

While significant work has been performed on view selection and query optimization algorithms in relational database systems, little attention has been paid to the problem of optimizing the performance of query workloads in RDF databases. In this paper we propose the notion of shortcuts, as a method for reducing the query processing cost. We then devise a greedy algorithm that, given a space constraint and a query workload in an RDF database, seeks to select the optimal shortcuts to materialize. Our experiments validate our approach and demonstrate that our algorithm manages to significantly reduce the query processing cost while keeping space requirements low.",

We adopt a simple conceptual modeling approach (taxonomies and intertaxonomy mappings) and we illustrate its advantages in terms of ease of use, uniformity, scalability, and efficiency.

            "Abstract": "Digital cultural repositories contain digital surrogates of cultural objects, objects born digital, or documentation data. The latter comprise data (or \u2018metadata\u2019) about physical or informational objects, as well as about the various related processes, such as acquisition, recording, digitization, research, conservation, exhibition, publication, etc. Interoperability of the different, autonomous repositories is important for the joint utilization of their contents. This, in turn, implies compliance with certain syntactic and semantic representation conditions determined by relevant standards and recommendations. The elaboration of information structures and associated guidelines that can support the development of interoperable digital cultural repositories, in particular of the respective documentation parts, for application on a national scale is the object of a Greek Information Society project we have undertaken. Drawing on the recommendations of various established international and national bodies concerning archaeological, ethnological, museological, archival, geographical, terminological and digital preservation data, and adopting as general frameworks for syntactic and semantic interoperability the standards of W3C and CIDOC CRM (ISO/DIS 21127) respectively, we have defined a set of appropriate information patterns that can meet the requirements of a large variety of cultural material in an integrated manner while maintaining enough flexibility to accommodate further special needs. This paper presents the approach and the main design decisions taken in this large information design project.",

The indexing of domain objects is done through conjunctive combinations of terms from the facets, called compound terms. A faceted taxonomy has several advantages over a single hierarchy of terms, including conceptual clarity, compactness and scalability. A drawback, however, is the cost of avoiding invalid combinations, ie compound terms that do not apply to any object in the domain. This need arises in both indexing and retrieval, and typically involves human effort for specifying the valid compound terms one by one. We here propose a compound term composition algebra which can be used to generate valid compound terms in a given faceted taxonomy in an efficient and flexible manner. It works on the basis of the original simple terms of the facets and a small set of positive and/or negative statements. In each algebraic operation, we adopt a closed-world assumption with respect to the declared positive or negative statements. The taxonomy algebra can be exploited in dynamically generating navigation trees, a significant browsing aid.",

To accomplish this, Telos was designed to be extensible in the sense that the concepts used to capture software knowledge can be defined in the language itself, instead of being built-in. This extensibility is accomplished through powerful metamodeling features, which proved very useful for interrelating heterogeneous models from requirements, model-driven software engineering, data integration, cultural informatics and eLearning. We trace the evolution of ideas and research results in the Telos project from its origins in the late eighties. Our account looks at the semantics of Telos, its various implementations and its applications. We also recount related research by other groups and the cross-influences of ideas thereof.

Unlike usual named entity recognition and relation extraction tasks, we are facing textual descriptions of activities of widely variable length, while pairs of successive activities often span multiple sentences. We developed and experimented with several sliding window classifiers using Logistic Regression, SVMs, and Random Forests, as well as a two-stage pipeline classifier. Our classifiers employ task-specific features, as well as word, part-of-speech and dependency embeddings, engineered to exploit distinctive traits of research publications written in English.

Digital methods are a core element of what has been called the \u201cmethodological commons\u201d: the intellectual, disciplinary, and methodological framework that underlies the conceptualization and understanding of digital humanities. The term \u201cmethod\u201d is used to refer to the computer\u2010based (also called information and communications technology, or ICT) techniques for the creation, analysis, communication, and dissemination of digital research. This chapter revisits the theory of computer\u2010based methods as a core construct (or \u201cscholarly primitive\u201d) of the digital humanities. It reviews two significant collaborative research support initiatives to investigate the use of ICT methods in the humanities, and explores the interdependencies between digital methods and the content and computer\u2010based tools they are used with across these \u2026",

This paper presents the approach and research agenda adopted by the newly-founded Digital Curation Unit of Athena Research Centre, Greece, and illustrates its relevance to the management and use of cultural heritage digital collections. It highlights the need to tackle the risks of epistemic failure tied with the prospect of long-term access to curated repositories, and presents the case for multidisciplinary research, informed by humanistic and social science as well as computer science perspectives. A multi-tiered research agenda, it argues, would need to resolve problems of representing domain knowledge; developing and maintaining knowledge resources; streamlining the enrichment of these resources from text; automatically generating text from databases; discovering and accessing domain associations; enabling the use of databases containing valuable data over time; conceptualizations of epistemic discourse, and communication genres in specific contexts; grounded research on the motives, activities and contexts of digital resources appraisal, knowledge enhancement and use; and, cost-benefit assessment of preservation policies. These complementary approaches are particularly relevant in the field of cultural heritage, where large-scale digitisation of heritage resources on one hand, and web-based social computing on the other, already create a deluge of un-curated and poorly represented cultural information.",

Improving the performance of RDF databases necessitates the development of specialized data management techniques, such as the use of shortcuts in the place of path queries. In this paper we deal with the problem of selecting the most beneficial shortcuts that reduce the execution cost of path queries in RDF databases given a space constraint. We first demonstrate that this problem is an instance of the quadratic knapsack problem. Given the computational complexity of solving such problems, we then develop an alternative formulation based on a bi-criterion linear relaxation, which essentially seeks to minimize a weighted sum of the query cost and of the required space consumption. As we demonstrate in this paper, this relaxation leads to very efficient classes of linear \u2026",

This vast amount of information that is either digitized or born-digital needs to be collected, organized and preserved in a way that ensures that our digital assets and the information they carry remain available for future use. Digital curation has emerged as a new inter-disciplinary practice that seeks to set guidelines for disciplined management of information. In this paper we review two recent models for digital curation introduced by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and the Digital Curation Unit (DCU) of the Athena Research Centre. We then propose a fusion of the two models that highlights the need to extend the digital curation lifecycle by adding (a) provisions for the registration of usage experience,(b) a stage for knowledge enhancement and (c) controlled vocabularies used by convention to denote concepts, properties and relations. The objective of the proposed extensions is twofold:(i) to provide a more complete lifecycle model for the digital curation domain; and (ii) to provide a stimulus for a broader discussion on the research agenda.",

We give a model-theoretic interpretation to these extended ontologies and we provide mechanisms for inferring the valid combinations of terms.

Then, we introduce the possibility of structuring the contents of a context through the traditional abstraction mechanisms, i.e., classification, generalization, and attribution.

The indexing of domain objects is done through conjunctive combinations of terms from the facets, called compound terms. A faceted taxonomy has several advantages over a single hierarchy of terms, including conceptual clarity, compactness and scalability. A drawback, however, is the cost of avoiding invalid combinations, ie compound terms that do not app to any object in the domain. This need arises in both indexing and retrieval, and typically involves human effort for specifying the valid compound terms one by one. We here propose a compound term composition algebra which can be used to generate valid compound terms in a given faceted taxonomy in an efficient and flexible manner. It works on the basis of the original simple terms of the facets and a small set of positive and/or negative statements. In each algebraic operation, we adopt a closed-world assumption with respect to the declared positive or negative statements. The taxonomy algebra can be exploited in dynamically generating navigation trees, a significant browsing aid.",

Adding original digital cultural products and digital recordings of cultural information to these digital surrogates leads to an impressive collection of digital cultural material.As digital collections are created independently by autonomous organizations, the emergence of a unified digital space is neither automatic nor easy. Aside from the legal and organizational issues, certain conditions are required for repositories to be interoperable. These are primarily concerned with documentation data and processes.

            "Abstract": "Digital libraries (DLs) are major advances in information technology that frequently fall short of expectations [7, 28]. Covi & Kling [7] argue that understanding the wider context of technology use is essential to understanding digital library use and its-plementation in different social worlds. Recent health informatics research also-gues that social and organisational factors can determine the success or failure of healthcare IT developments [8, 11, 12]. Heathfield [11] suggests that this is due to the complex, autonomous nature of the medical discipline and the specialized (clinician or software engineer) approach to system development. Negative reactions to these systems is often due to inappropriate system design and poor implementation. H-ever, there may be other less obvious social and political repercussions of information system design and deployment. Symon et al [26] have identified, within a hospital scenario, how social structures and work practices can be disrupted by technology implementation. Although these systems often deal with sensitive, personal infor-tion, other system design research has found that apparently innocuous data can be perceived as a threat to social and political stability [1, 2, 3]. To understand the impact of DLs within the medical profession, an in-depth evaluation is required of the int-duction and later development of these applications within their specific social and organisational settings. However, as Covi & Kling [7] have highlighted, there are few high-level theories that aid designers in understanding the implication of these issues for DL design and implementation.",

It thus provides a basis for developing domain-specific scholarly work ontologies springing from a common root. We define the basic concepts of the model and their semantic relations through four complementary perspectives on scholarly work: activity, procedure, resource and agency.

            "Abstract": "The long-term preservation of digital resources requires assigning appropriate metadata. Several recommendations exist for preservation metadata reflecting the purposes and major preoccupations of the organizations that proposed each one. Digital resources are either digital surrogates of non-digital objects, or original digital objects. In either case we may assume that, if a digital resource is selected for preservation, it can be considered as a cultural object that belongs to some collection, has a certain value and must be appropriately preserved, used and documented. In other words, although the digital nature of the resource induces specific requirements in terms of preservation policies and techniques, basic commonalities can be traced with other cultural objects at the functional level. Based on this premise, the work reported here aims at harmonizing the information structures supporting digital preservation with those for documenting nondigital cultural objects. The approach taken is to develop a conceptual model for preservation metadata that complies with a standard ontology for cultural documentation, namely CIDOC CRM. The perils faced by digital resources are related either to physical causes or to technological evolution. Correspondingly a number of preservation strategies have been developed and a preservation life cycle, independent of preservation strategy, has been identified. Furthermore, several proposals for preservation metadata have been made, five of which, appearing to be the most interesting and influential, namely the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), the Curl \u2026",

To overcome semantic and schematic discrepancies among the various data sources the protocol relies on a world view of information as a flat list of fields, called Access Points (AP). One of the major issues for building Z39.50 wrappers is to map this unstructured list of APs to the underlying source data structure and semantics. For highly structured sources (e.g., database management systems, knowledge base systems) this mapping is quite complex and considerably affects the quality of the retrieved data. Unfortunately, existing Z39.50 wrappers have been developed from scratch and they do not provide high-level mapping languages with verifiable properties.
