The implementation is based on Digital Signal Processing and physical modeling techniques for the instrument\u2019s two parts: the excitation mechanism and the acoustic resonator with toneholes. Single-reeded instruments are in-depth studied firstly because their excitation mechanism is the one used in a great amount of modern wind-reed instruments and secondly because the physics governing the phenomena is less complicated than the double-reeded instruments. We here provide a detailed model of a system comprised of a double-reed linked to an acoustic resonator with toneholes to sonify Aulos. We validate our results by comparing our method\u2019s synthesized signal with recordings from a replica of Aulos of Poseidonia built in our lab.

As happens with most religious music genres, reverberation is a key element of Byzantine music. Byzantine churches/cathedrals are usually characterized by particularly diffuse fields and very long Reverberation Time (RT) values. In the first part of this work, the perceptual effect of long reverberation on Byzantine music excerpts is investigated. Then, a case where Byzantine music is recorded in non-ideal acoustic conditions is considered. In such scenarios, a sound engineer might require to add artificial reverb on the recordings. Here it is suggested that the step of adding extra reverberation can be preceded by a dereverberation processing to suppress the originally recorded non ideal reverberation.

There are cases, however, where either the generator modules produce pieces of non-analyzed, non-annotated plain text, or such modules are not available at all. Moreover, the language analysis is restricted by the usually limited domain coverage of the generator due to its embedded grammar. This work reports on a language-independent framework basis, linguistic resources and language analysis procedures (word/sentence identification, part-of-speech, prosodic feature annotation) for text annotation/processing for plain or enriched text corpora.

            "Abstract": "This paper we report on an interdisciplinary project for modeling Greek chant with real-time vocal synthesis. Building on previous research, we employ a hybrid musical instrument: Phonodeon (Georgaki et al. 2005), consisting of a MIDI-accordeon coupled to a real-time algorithmic interaction and vocal synthesis engine. The synthesis is based on data provided by the AOIDOS program developed in the Department of the Computer science of the University of Athens, investigating Greek liturgical chant compared to bel canto singing. Phonodeon controls expressive vocal synthesis models based on formant synthesis and concatenated filtered samples. Its bellows serve as hardware control device that is physically analogous to the human breathing mechanism [georgaki, 1998a], while the buttons of the right hand can serve multiple functions. On the level of pitch structure, this paper focuses on a particular aspect of control, namely that of playing in the traditional non-tempered and flexible interval structure of Greek modes (\u03ae\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9: echoi) while using the 12-semitone piano-type keyboard of the left hand. This enables the musical exploration of the relationship between the spectral structure of the vocal timbre of Greek chant and characteristic intervals occuring in the modal structure of the chant. To implement that, we developed techniques for superimposing interval patterns of the modes on the keyboard of the phonodeon. The work is the first comprehensive interactive model of antique, medieval and modern near-eastern tunings. The techniques developed can be combined with techniques for other control aspects, such as timbre and vocal expression \u2026",

We conclude that Fitts\u2019 law can only describe able-bodied users\u2019 performance when selecting targets with the mouse. On the other hand, the performance of both user groups with the BCI, and of motionimpaired users with the mouse does not conform to Fitts\u2019 law.

The experimental results after the user evaluation indicate that the acoustic rendition of font size variations as well as bold and italics is recognized successfully, but bold-italics are confused with bold, due to the similarities of their prosodic variations.",

Moreover, after the introduction of a set of metrics, the accuracy of the evaluation of ANN based spatial and time series AT and RH modeling in the case of a specific region is examined, by applying a number of alternative feed forward ANN topologies. The Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm was used for the ANNs training in the temporal forecasting of AT and RH, with the optimum architecture being the one that minimizes the Mean Absolute Error on the validation set.

This paper proposes a methodology for the emotional assessment and annotation of words. The process is based on the Self Assessment Manikin test, and is coupled with two psychometric measurements for identifying possible bias due to the annotator\u2019s psychological condition and personality: the EPQ scale and the SCL-90-R scale. A web based tool was developed to support the process. The methodology was validated through a pilot study in which 10 participants were asked to assess the emotional state elicited by each of 75 verbs that were used as stimuli. Results are compared with SentiWordNet\u2019s emotional scoring on respective verbs, and primarily show logical continuity and consistency.",

            "Abstract": "This work describes the design and implementation of the DAMASKINOS chanting voices corpus that includes a representative number of Greek Orthodox Ecclesiastical Music (GOEM) styles. The essential characteristic of DAMASKINOS is the fact that it is not based on preexisting chanting performances or on recordings under nonidentical conditions. What makes this collection unique is that DAMASKINOS relies on rigorous design requirements and strict implementation specifications. Following specific criteria, twenty famous professional psaltes (chanters) from different parts of Greece were selected. They were invited to chant the same set of selected Byzantine troparia (hymns) of papadikon, sticherarikon and eirmologikon melodic forms in all the eight modes of GOEM. Their voices were digitally recorded under the same well-controlled conditions. Both the sound-pressure (microphonic) and the synchronized ElectroGlottoGraphic (EGG) signals were captures and digitized. Moreover, the recordings include: a) chanting of exercises in GOEM scales in each Byzantine mode and b) reading-aloud the texts of chanted hymns (ie a type of ecclesiastical speech). In some cases the recordings include aerophone measurements in order to collect additional information, such as subglottic pressure and glottal airflow. By applying a semi-automatic methodology, the recorded signals of the DAMASKINOS corpus were synchronized with additional tagging meta-data in five levels: a) musical syllable boundaries, b) characters of musical notation, c) notation-based (expected) pitch, d) real (performed) pitch and e) transcription of chanted voice.

Our goal is to implement a score-to-singing synthesis system, where the score is written in a score editor and saved in the midi format. However, MBROLA accepts phonetic files as input rather than midi ones and because of this, we construct a midi-file to phonetic-file converter, which applies irrespective of the underlying language. The evaluation of the Greek singing voice synthesis system is achieved through a psycho acoustic experiment. The thirty participants are given two samples and are asked to evaluate them according to vocalness, naturalness, intelligibility and expressivity, in a 1-5 scale MOS test. The results are encouraging, with naturalness and expressivity being ranked above 2.5 in average. Thereafter, we create a new diphone database \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Human-human spoken dialogues are considered an important tool for effective speech interface design and are often used for stochastic model training in speech based applications. However, the less restricted nature of human-human interaction compared to human-system interaction may undermine the usefulness of such corpora for creating effective and usable interfaces. In this respect, this work examines the differences between corpora collected from human-human interaction and corpora collected from actual system use, in order to formally assess the appropriateness of the former for both the design and implementation of spoken dialogue systems. Comparison results show that there are significant differences with respect to vocabulary, sentence structure and speech recognition success rate among others. Nevertheless, compared to other available tools and techniques, human-human dialogues may still be used as a temporary at least solution for building more effective working systems. Accordingly, ways to better utilize such resources are presented.",

The prediction of these elements robustly relies on the accuracy and the quality of error-prone linguistic procedures, such as the identification of the part-of-speech and the syntactic tree. Additional linguistic factors, such as rhetorical relations, improve the naturalness of the prosody, but are hard to extract from plain texts. In this work, we are proposing a method to generate enhanced prosodic events for TtS by utilizing accurate, error-free and high-level linguistic information. We are also presenting an appropriate XML annotation scheme to encode syntax, grammar, new or given information, phrase subject/object information, as well as rhetorical elements.

The results depicted that the participants\u2019 reading errors (phonological type) were similar in both braille codes. In addition, the participants performed more fluid hand movements when they used the six-dot braille code, whereas they spent less time when they were reading through eight-dot braille.

We have utilized two 500-utterance prosodic corpora offered by two Greek universities in order to compare the machine learning approaches and to argue on the robustness they offer for Greek break modeling.

We are introducing the use of a Time Encoded Signal Processing method to produce simple matrices from complex sound waveforms, for in-strument note encoding and recognition. These matrices are presented to a Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) to perform instrument recognition with promising results in organ classification and reduced computational cost. The evaluation material consists of 470 tones from 19 musical instruments synthe-sized with 5 wide used synthesizers (Microsoft Synth, Creative SB Live!

            "Abstract": "Most of the every day documents we come across have been composed without any information of how to be rendered in a speech-based user interface. As a result, visual formations that might imply emphasis are being ignored by Text-to-Speech systems or text-adapting applications (screen readers) and furthermore, complex structures, such as tables, are usually being vocalized in a rough linearized form, which leads to a confusing provision of information. In this work we accommodate both cases, by altering segments of emphasis in the content text, leaving a prosodic space for the vocalization of meta-information as well. We present a model for locating emphatic events and assigning to them a custom prosodic behaviour. Events are being divided in implicit and explicit ones. We concluded that the latter requires insertions of text to the linear form of structures in order to be properly realized. A script-based framework (e-TSA Composer) that supports the manipulation of prosodic elements in response of specific meta-information has been used. Finally, a model of table vocalization using our approach shows the significant improvement of the information provision compared to commercial applications.",

Extraction methodologies for the formatting metadata can be used on such structured documents for enhancing their accessibility, including augmented audio representation of documents. To the best of our knowledge, an effort has yet to be made to produce an automatic extraction system of semantic information of the document formatting, solely from document layout, without the use of natural language processing. In this study a corpus of XML representations of several issues of a Greek newspaper is used in order to create and evaluate a semantic classifier of text formatting, based on Bayesian Networks.",

            "Abstract": "Traditionally a \u201cdocument\u201d was considered as a textual record. Schamber (1996) defined document as a unit \u201cconsisting of dynamic, flexible, nonlinear content, represented as a set of linked information items, stored in one or more physical media or networked sited; created and used by one or more individuals in the facilitation of some process or project\u201d. Buckland (1997) tries to answer the question \u201cwhat is a document?\u201d through a discussion on how far the meaning of \u201cdocument\u201d can be pushed and which are the limits of \u201cdocumentation\u201d. The evolution of Computer Science and Information Technology created a new perspective for the word \u201cdocument\u201d. The concept \u201celectronic documents\u201d can be differentiated from the \u201cprinted documents\u201d having specific characteristics (Schamber, 1996): easily manipulabable, internally and externally linkable, readily transformable, inherently searchable, instantly transportable and infinitely replicable. The term document used in this chapter refers to all kind of printed or electronic documentation the content of which is most text, like newspapers, books, journals, magazines, educational material, letters, brochures, leaflets, etc. A document contains elements that arrange content in the page or even in the document itself. For example, the title of a chapter can be recognized by placing it on the top of the page and in larger font size than the body of text. Also, page indexing at the end of a document links the reader to specific part of the document. The document functionality can be distinguished into browsing, searching, navigation and reading (Doermann et al., 1998). Additional concepts related to document\u2019s \u2026",

            "Abstract": "System usability is defined as the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Usability is regarded as one of the aspects of software quality, and as such it can be described alternatively as \u201cquality in use\u201d. Since usability is only defined within a certain context of use, we can deduce that it cannot be considered as an inherent attribute of a product, but it has to be studied by studying the users themselves.Ease of use has long been a major concern within software development and the industry has realized that in order to achieve such a quality, a user-centered approach is needed. However, User-Centered Design (UCD) constitutes a considerable paradigm shift in the development process and this has hindered the adoption of UCD methods. Thus, it is fairly recently that more systematic approaches have been considered and efforts have been made to integrate such methods in the software development process. Moreover, the proliferation of the World Wide Web has increased the need for developing usable systems, since the designers have to cater for a much more diversified user base. In addition, the Internet has lead to an increase in the number of people that develop software and has shrunk the amount of time from the inception of an idea to its development as an application and its deployment to the market. Advances in ICT have complicated modern applications and their interfaces, making them harder to use. As a consequence of all the above, a considerable lack of usability can be observed in the Web today, despite the \u2026",

Moreover, the overall mean response time of the identification task is provided. Participants identify better the lower three dot elevations for both lines and squares on 20 or 10 dpi, with an exception for 20 dpi squares where the highest dot elevation is third in the order of recognition. The application of a multilevel model fitting to the data indicated significant effects for the role of the DOTs (raised dot lines versus raised dot squares) with the raised dot squares being associated with significantly elevated correct responding.

For component developers ULYSSES provides an engineering-for-reuse environment with guidelines and tools to build software components, which can operate effectively and interact with each other transparently, without even being aware of each other's existence. Components with different functionality, developed by independent manufacturers can be deployed using various programming languages. Furthermore, ULYSSES grants a process of engineering-with-reuse for system integrators to take advantage of the reusable assets produced during engineering-for-reuse. Thus, selection and assembly of components on demand for building user-specific robust products out of pre-fabricated software parts is becoming an easy task for system integrators.",

Good Practices included in this Inventory incorporate methods, techniques, approaches or lessons, which apply the UDL principles and guidelines. The basic selection criteria for an UDLnet Good Practice were: transferable, adaptable, flexible and effective. Media Resources complement the UDL Good Practices and relate to the pedagogical approach applied by the educationalist and the instructional material used. Collections provide the facility to gather, link, and organize different UDL Good Practices and Media Resources together. The UDLnet Inventory is not static. It is a growing and dynamic space whose main purpose is to stimulate new reasoning and practices and challenge existing ones.",

Our metrics are demonstrated in a pilot user study evaluating the Greek audio rendering rules of MathPlayer with 7 participants and 39 stimuli. We observed that the obtained results for the metrics are significantly correlated between all three approaches.",

We utilize two tree-structured predictors, the commonly used CART and a C4. 5, to predict break placement from sequences of easy to extract shallow textual features. We are experimenting with two 500-utterance sized prosodic corpora developed by two Greek universities that originate from different domains in order to focus on the differences in prediction between generic and limited domain datasets. The evaluation shows that while the limited dataset achieves better accuracy than the generic one in the CART case, this difference is lowered with the introduction of C4. 5. Minor breaks proved to be the most difficult class to predict in CART case, while we achieved a 50% of improvement with C4. 5.",

Though progress in speech synthesis allows the consistent control of an abundance of parameters, like prosody through appropriate mark-up, there is not enough experimentally proven specification input data to drive a Voice Browser for such purposes. This paper reports on the results from a series of psychoacoustic experiments aiming to provide natural speech prosodic specification for the task of vocalizing tables. Blind and sighted listeners were asked to reconstruct simple and complex data tables from naturally spoken descriptions. From the listeners\u2019 feedback it was deducted that consistent prosodic rendering can model the underlying semantic structure of tables.",

            "Abstract": "A simulation of a musical instrument is considered to be a successful one when there is a good resemblance between the model\u2019s synthesized sound and the real instrument\u2019s sound. In this work, we propose the integration of physical modeling (PM) methods with an optimization process to regulate a generated digital signal. Its goal is to find a new set of values of the PM\u2019s parameters\u2019 that would lead to a synthesized signal matching as much as possible to reference signals corresponding to the physical musical instrument. The reference signals can be: (a) described by their acoustic characteristics (e.g., fundamental frequencies, inharmonicity, etc.) and/or (b) the signals themselves (e.g., impedances, recordings, etc.). We put this method into practice for a commercial recorder, simulated using the digital waveguides\u2019 PM technique. The reference signals, in our case, are the recorded signals of the physical instrument. The degree of similarity between the synthesized (PM) and the recorded signal (musical instrument) is calculated by the signals\u2019 linear cross-correlation. Our results show that the adoption of the optimization process resulted in more realistic synthesized signals by (a) enhancing the degree of similarity between the synthesized and the recorded signal (the average absolute Pearson Correlation Coefficient increased from 0.13 to 0.67), (b) resolving mistuning issues (the average absolute deviation of the synthesized from the recorded signals\u2019 pitches reduced from 40 cents to the non-noticeable level of 2 cents) and (c) similar sound color characteristics and matched overtones (the average absolute deviation of the synthesized from \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Writing is employed by humans in order to communicate, exchange ideas or store facts and descriptions. A well known Latin phrase is \u201cverba volant, scripta manent\u201d ie \u201cspoken words fly away, written words remain\u201d. Humans in prehistoric years, used figurations to describe several events and express their fear or their admiration, the ancient Egyptians used papyrus to write down their ideas and the Chinese, in 11th Century, went beyond handwriting using typography with moveable type to create multiple copies of their documents. Through centuries typography has evolved and nowadays is one of the major manners to exchange ideas and information.Using computers, typography and the way we write has changed radically. We have a plethora of software tools, eg for writing a plain text (like NotePad in MS Windows), word processors (eg Open Office) for text editing as well as for more elegant visual appearance of the documents and professional tools for the creation of posters, advertisements etc (eg Adobe\u2019s Tools and Editors). Utilising these tools, computer users have the ability not only to write a plain text, but also to format the text and arrange it in the page. In newspapers, for example, the page designer distinguishes the title from the body of text at the top of the page or the article, with larger font size. Also, when an editor wishes to emphasize a specific word or phrase he uses bold or italics typesetting. A writer can convey a message, a felling or an idea not only by the meaning of the content but also by the way the text is visually presented to the reader. Page layout affects the way a newspaper is read (Holmqvist & Wartenberg, 2005 \u2026",

Furthermore, free software often needs to be tested and reviewed by computer and AT experts in order to detect and point out reliability, installation, and compatibility issues. We propose a methodology for creating web-based free AT software inventories, which will make the search and selection of such products straightforward. The methodology is based on the systematic organization and consistency of the information available for each product, and its effective presentation; the goal for the users is to be able to quickly find, compare \u2026",

            "Abstract": "There are two issues that are challenging in the life-cycle of Digital Talking Books (DTB): the automatic labeling of text formatting meta-data in documents and the multimodal representation of the text formatting semantics. We propose an augmented design-for-all approach for both the production and the reading processes of DAISY compliant DTBs. This approach incorporates a methodology for the real-time extraction and the semantic labeling of text formatting meta-data. Furthermore, it includes a unified approach for the multimodal rendering of text formatting, structure and layout meta-data by utilizing a Document-to-Audio platform to render the acoustic modality.",

For the 3D experiments we introduced a novel experiment layout, supplementing the ISO. We examine the pointing devices\u2019 conformance to Fitts\u2019 law and we measure a number of extra parameters that describe more accurately the cursor movement trajectories. Throughput, measured in bits per second is the most important performance measure. For the 2D tasks using Microsoft Kinect, Throughput is almost 39% lower than using the mouse, Target Re-Entry is 10 times up and Missed Clicks count is almost 50% higher. However, for the 3D tasks the mouse has a 9% lower Throughput than the Kinect, while Target Re-Entry and Missed Clicks are almost \u2026",

We present in this paper the design and implementation of a multimedia spelling-book based on the above theory. The book presents the story of the\" beautiful Helen\" as Homer records it. The review of the current conventional spelling books for pupils combined with the characteristics of the Homer Epics and the different ways of using images, led us to the formation of a set of parameters, assumptions and aims for the interactive learning environment. The methodology we followed to end up with the design and development of the multimedia spelling-book is given in detail along with implementation issues and the description of the application. The system is expandable (more scenes) and transferable (other stories). The application is currently undergoing user trials in real life \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Dot elevation and dot density are two main variables that dominate the recognition and conceptualization of tactile embossed graphics by blind individuals. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated tactile sensitivity to the elevation (third dimension) of tactile graphics. In a pilot experiment we conducted recently using 8 dot elevations of embossed lines and squares, in 20 or 10 dpi, produced by a Tiger VP200 braille embosser, we observed that participants can detect only two highs with accuracy above 50%. We present here the results of an experimental study with 30 congenitally blind participants to investigate the detection accuracy of embossed tactile lines and squares in four selected dot elevations among the eight possible dot heights that can be produced by the VP200 embosser. A total of 1,920 responses were recorded. The detection accuracy and response time of the matching task were examined for each type of test stimuli. The results of correct and misclassified stimuli are presented in confusion matrixes for the raised-dot lines and squares stimuli. Moreover, the overall mean response time of the detection task is provided. We observed that in all cases, only the stimuli with the lower two heights H-1 and H-3 provide detection accuracy above 70%.",

In this paper, after the introduction of an appropriate document architecture, we analyze the semantics of the document signals. Then, by following a Design-for-All methodology, we present the Document-to-Audio approach we have developed for the automatics rendering document signals from the typographic, logical and the layout layers to the auditory modality.",

            "Abstract": "This study explores differences in structure and functionality of the regular and mobile websites of four different Online Social Networks (OSN) with regard to blind users. OSN help connecting people from various ages, cultures and social backgrounds worldwide. But since the regular websites of OSN are very complex, blind users rely on the mobile website which has a simpler, clearer and more straightforward structure and thus is much more suitable for screen readers. Besides, there are more and more sighted mobile-only users who also access their OSN via the mobile website. Due to the nature of the mobile website\u2013to conform to the requirements of mobile devices\u2013there will be structural differences. Therefore, this study\u2019s main goal is to figure out whether mobile-only users might miss important functions. The results of the study show that there are reduced and omitted functions that limit the user, especially for privacy issues, so that the regular website of OSN is indispensable for certain settings. As the results also show structural differences that are not only due to the requirements of mobile devices, switching back and forth between the mobile and regular website, eg for those certain settings, raises difficulties.",

In this work we deal with the evaluation of corpus-based models in operational environments other than the training ones. Two pitch accent frameworks derived by linguistically enriched speech data from a generic domain and a limited domain were initially evaluated by applying the 10-fold cross validation method. As a second step, we utilized the cross domains data validation. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, we further employed three machine learning approaches, CART, Naive Bayes and Bayesian networks. The results demonstrate that the limited domain models achieve in average 10% improved accuracy in self-domain evaluation, while the generic models preserve a their performance regardless the domain of application.",

Following basic design-for-all principles, during a forty-five minutes teaching process, in which ten congenitally blind and ten sighted students participated, the educational material was presented in both visual and acoustic modalities, using an interactive whiteboard. An interview was then followed with each student in order to investigate their understanding of the scientific concepts of OA. The results of this study showed that congenitally blind and sighted students, after this alternative teaching process, experienced less difficulty in understanding the concepts of OA.",

In this work, we introduce a corpus based F0 model to improve the naturalness over rule-based approaches in such embedded platforms. A target selection method is proposed that picks out and copies pitch targets over syllables. To cope with the poor feature availability, prosodic structures are organized in an onset/mid/offset segmentation of phrases produced by a shallow parser. The proposed method focuses on the fine pitch target representation of the onset and offset sections, which perceptually are of greatest importance. The results indicate that this approach fits well with the specification of short \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The auditory formation of visual-oriented documents is a process that enables the delivery of a more representative acoustic image of documents via speech interfaces. We have set up an experimental environment for conducting a series of complex psycho-acoustic experiments to evaluate users\u2019 performance in recognizing synthesized auditory components that represent visual structures. For our purposes, we exploit an open, XML-based platform that drives a Voice Browser and transforms documents\u2019 visual meta-information to speech synthesis markup formalism. A user-friendly graphical interface allows the investigator to build acoustic variants of documents. First, a source de-compilation method builds a logical layer that abstractly classifies visual meta-information. Then, the investigator can define distinctive sound fonts in a free way by assigning combined prosodic parameters and non-speech audio sounds to the logical elements. Four blind and four sighted student subjects were asked about their distinctive ability in response to several controlled versions of auditory components, as well as their opinion on the quality of the selected features. The results provided evidence to discuss the general hypothesis that the mean scores for blind and sighted students in recognizing differentiated auditory components are equal. Also, we extracted some preliminary data for the evaluation of the appropriateness of several sound fonts in the auditory representation of visual components in cases of WWW documents.",

As there is a lack of studies on how blind perceive them and aiming to incorporate them efficiently in advanced TtS systems, we investigate in a systematic way the perception of the main typographic text-signals by 73 blind and sighted students. The results show that both groups of the participants perceive that font-styles are used largely to better locate, recognize or distinguish the topics or specific information in a document. Almost half of the sighted argue that they are useful for the comprehension of the content, but only 4 % of the blind students perceive the same.

            "Abstract": "This paper discusses the design of a web interface for policy argumentation modeling. Given the complexity of the interface the WAI-ARIA descriptions were used to ensure that the data were accessible and the visual-heavy presentation was simplified. Conclusions were drawn as to the usefulness of the WAI-ARIA guidelines to an elaborate design of user interaction with highly dynamic content.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the user requirements of young adults with blindness regarding the information to be included/ mapped in two different types of audio-tactile mobility maps: (a) audio-tactile maps of indoors, and (b) audio-tactile maps of campuses. Forty young adults (aged from 18 years to 30 years) with blindness took part in the research. Participants came from four countries: 14 from Greece, 2 from Cyprus, 18 from Turkey, and 6 from Germany. The researchers developed two lists of information to be included in the two types of audio-tactile maps (indoor and campus) respectively. Participants were asked to evaluate the information, regarding: (a) the significance of the information in regard to safety, location of services, way finding and orientation during movement, and (b) the frequency the participants meet the information (within their surrounding and the environment they move in \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Text documents usually embody visually oriented meta-information in the form of complex visual structures, such as tables. The semantics involved in such objects result in poor and ambiguous text-to-speech synthesis. Although most speech synthesis frameworks allow the consistent control of an abundance of parameters, such as prosodic cues, through appropriate markup, there is no actual prosodic specification to speech-enable visual elements. This paper presents a method for the acoustic specification modelling of simple and complex data tables, derived from the human paradigm. A series of psychoacoustic experiments were set up for providing speech properties obtained from prosodic analysis of natural spoken descriptions of data tables. Thirty blind and 30 sighted listeners selected the most prominent natural rendition. The derived prosodic phrase accent and pause break placement vectors \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Electronic texts carry important meta-information (such as tags in HTML) that most of the current Text-to-Speech (TtS) systems ignore during the production of the speech. We propose an approach to exploit this meta-information in order to achieve a detailed auditory representation of an e-text. The e-Text to Speech and Audio (e-TSA) Composer has been designed and developed as an XML based scripting framework that can be adopted by existing TtS, with minor or major modifications. It provides a mechanism to create scripts using combined elements from e-texts and TtS systems. The e-TSA Composer can manipulate the behaviour of a TtS (eg the applied prosody) in order to define a finest vocalisation in response to specific e-texts.",

            "Abstract": "Archeomusicologists commonly use methods based on the physical properties and the relative tuning system of a musical instrument in order to estimate its tones. However, because the musician often alters the tones' frequency, for example, while playing in wind instruments by means of embouchure or by stressing the string in string instruments, the current methods that neglect the musician's interaction with the instrument cannot provide solid results. In this work, we introduce ENTROTUNER, a computational method, based on mathematical optimization, to more accurately estimate the generated tones by considering: the instrument as a sound production mechanism, the relevant musical scale(s), and the musician's interaction with the instrument. We simulate this interaction as a system that, by following tuning rules, aims to maximize the partials' overlap (harmonicity), coded as entropy's minimization of the \u2026",

The prediction of the underlying pitch targets robustly relies on the quality of the predicted prosodic structures, i.e. the corresponding sequences of tones and breaks. In the present work, we have utilized a linguistically enriched annotated corpus to build data-driven models for predicting prosodic structures with increased accuracy. We have then used a linear regression approach for the F0 modeling. An appropriate XML annotation scheme has been introduced to encode syntax, grammar, new or already given information, phrase subject/object information, as well as rhetorical elements in the corpus, by exploiting a Natural Language Generator (NLG) system. To prove the benefits from the introduction of the enriched input meta-information, we first show that while tone and break CART predictors have high accuracy when standing alone (92.35% for \u2026",

The rules are used in an automated procedure that assigns text's formatting and structure of documents (meta-data) to emotional state values. During the vocalization of documents, these values, and consequently the documents' meta-data, are carried by different expressions of speech using text-to-speech synthesis.

Two methods of analysis have been applied: the first based on the analytical signal and the second on the crests and troughs of the waveform of the vibrato signal. Tones-samples were extracted from ascending and descending music scales, chanted by five famous singers for all the Greek vowels. The two analysis methods produced identical results in the level of significance, a= 0.05, concerning the mean extent, the mean standard deviation of the rate and the mean intonation, while they differed in the rate (1.9-6.6%), the mean standard deviation of the extent (4-6 cents) and the standard deviation of intonation (0.46-1.20 Hz). Typical values of the average rate within a tone were found to be 5.35 Hz (SD: 0.96 Hz) and 5.13 Hz (SD: 0.95 Hz), while the most frequent values were 4.8 Hz and 4.5 Hz, for the first and second method, respectively. The average extent within a tone was 50 cents (SD: 18 cents). Moreover, the dependence of the vibrato parameters on pitch and sound intensity has been studied; there was no systematic relationship between them.",

The objective of the current study is to test the sensitivity and reliability of the IDEA system regarding the evaluation of multiple kinetic parameters of upper limbs. 29 patients who were hospitalized in the Demyelinating Diseases Section of Eginition Hospital's Neurological Clinic and 25 healthy participated in the experiments. Data derived from the experiment are complemented with demographics. The acquired results analysis reveals that the IDEA system sensitivity is high enough to predict the presence of early upper limb multiple \u2026",

We emphasize on traditional instruments, starting with the zournas. By analysis, acoustical aspects of the instrument are derived (attack-release time, spectral harmonic distribution, pitch and intensity contours et. c.). Moreover, in conjunction with measurements by a laryngograph, features of the player\u2019s performance style are recovered. The parameters extracted are necessary for developing virtual instruments by physical modeling. To be more precise, digital waveguide models will be used to simulate the sound wave propagation in the instrument.",

An experimental procedure was implemented conforming to International Affective Picture System guidelines and incorporating the Self-Assessment Manikin test. Thirty students participated in the experiment. The stimulus was a short paragraph of text for which any content, emotion, and/or domain dependent information was excluded.

We applied this experimental approach to evaluate an emotional prosodic model for Greek expressive Text-to-Speech synthesis. We used two pseudo-sentences for each of the Greek and English HMM-based synthetic voices, implemented in the MARY TtS platform. Fifteen native Greek participants were asked to assess eleven emotional states for each sentence.

UDL recognises the need to create opportunities for the inclusion of diverse learners by providing curricula and instructional activities that allow for multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement. In the first decade of its development, the emphasis in the domain of UDL was on the use of technology to inclusive education and accessibility for the disabled. Although UDL has great potential it has been hard to implement on a large scale. UDL requires collaborative planning amongst teachers with different curriculum knowledge and skills. Complaints that are often raised include lack of time to co-plan and lack of resources to teach a differentiated curriculum. Open Discovery Space is a portal to browse \u2026",

The method of analysis included a semi-automatic segmentation of the audio material, extraction of the measurements in PRAAT and the final post-processing in MATLAB. Results show clear evidence of formant tuning in at least six of the chanters, proving that the technique is in use by the modern Byzantine music performers.",

The two main tasks of the process are: onset-offset detection and vibrato identification and extraction. For the first task sound level and frequency level of the acoustical signal are used to determine all possible points for such transitions. The second task was based on fundamental frequency analysis using the YIN algorithm. Extra smoothing was applied to resolve issues from high frequency noise. Evaluation was performed by conducting a psychoacoustic experiment. Results show that the detection process proved to be accurate enough for processing \u2026",

Both schemes provide realistic classifications, differentiating in the number of the resulting circulation patterns. The two methods are compared by examining the distribution of each SOM circulation type members (days) to every k-means type and by investigating the pressure field correspondence along with their monthly and cumulative frequencies of occurrence. High similarity is observed, especially for the patterns where atmospheric circulation is controlled from high-pressure barometric systems. The SOM method is found to be superior, due to its ability to generate a non-linear classification and produce a map where closely related atmospheric modes are described by neighboring neurons and positioned in adjacent locations.",

Circulation type classification is a significant aspect of climate research in terms of examining the large-scale atmospheric variability and its relationship with local climate parameters. The study utilizes mean daily sea level pressure (MSLP) data for the spring months of a 62-year period (1948 to 2009) on a grid with 2.5ox2. 5o resolution. Both schemes provide realistic classifications, differentiating in the number of the resulting circulation patterns. The two methods are compared by examining the distribution of each SOM circulation type members (days) to every k-means type and by investigating the pressure field correspondence along with their frequencies of occurrence. High similarity is observed, especially for the patterns where atmospheric circulation is controlled from high-pressure barometric systems. The SOM method is found to be superior, due to its ability to generate a non-linear classification and produce a map where closely related atmospheric modes are described by neighboring neurons and positioned in adjacent locations.",

The existence of these STS sessions helped to bring the me-ing into sharper focus in several key areas of assistive technology. In turn, this deeper level of focus helped to bring together the state-of-the-art and mainstream technical, social, cultural and political developments. Our keynote speaker, Jim Fruchterman from BeneTech, USA highlighted the-portance of giving access to ICT and AT at a global level. In another keynote by H-old Thimbleby, Swansea University, UK, the role of user-centred design and usability engineering in assistive technology and accessibility was addressed.

After reviewing the theoretical background as well as the relative advantages and limitations of ANN methodologies applicable to the field of air temperature time series and spatial modelling, this work focuses on implementation issues and on evaluating the accuracy of the AAN methodologies using a set of metrics in the case of a specific region with complex terrain. A number of alternative feed forward ANN topologies have been applied in order to assess the spatial and time series air temperature prediction capabilities in different horizons. For the temporal forecasting of air temperature ANNs were trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm with the optimum architecture being the one that minimizes the Mean Absolute Error on the validation set. For the spatial estimation of air temperature the Radial Basis Function and Multilayer Perceptrons non-linear Feed Forward AANs schemes are compared. The underlying air temperature temporal and spatial variability is found to be modeled efficiently by the ANNs.",

Byzantine churches have extremely long Reverberation Time and their acoustics is dominated by the contributions of the diffuse sound field. Thus, the sound character of Byzantine chanting is closely linked to the acoustic reverberation. In this work we examine the perceived preference for the various features of reverberation imposed on excerpts of Byzantine psalms. This is achieved by simulations of typical churches with varying internal volume, reverberation time and source/receiver distance, utilizing chants from the DAMASKINOS corpus. The simulation (auralization) results were evaluated via statistical preference method using a group of 15 listeners. The results of such controlled experiments illustrate the listener preferences and acceptability of various parameters or combinations of parameters related to reverberation, eg of the Reverberation Time value in relation to church dimensions and listener position inside the church.",

            "Abstract": "The evolution of hand-held devices has made possible the porting of high quality Text-to-Speech systems to embedded platforms. However, linguistic resources required to build natural-sounding prosody models still need to be scaled down, to meet the hardware specifications of the devices. In this work, we present a compact intonation model that brings together the naturalness of corpus based prosody modeling with the limited nature of the embedded TtS applications. A sampling process of 3 points per syllable over a small set of appropriately set up utterances is used as the tonal unit database. The sampled points are applied at synthesis time over an onset/offset syllabic structuring of phrases. The model requires less than 1KB of storage for modeling each prosodic phrase class. The application to the Greek language is being demonstrated utilizing only lexical stress information.",

            "Abstract": "Current Text-to-Speech systems, commonly used for document accessibility, do not include an effective and standard acoustic provision of the visual typographic cues embedded in them. In this work, we first introduce the text signals (ie the writing devices that emphasize aspects of a text\u2019s content or structure) along with an appropriate architecture for the structure of documents as well as the main principles and technological topics of document accessibility. Then, the emerging technological approach of Document-to-Audio (DtA) we have developed is presented. DtA essentially constitutes the next generation of Text-to-Speech systems that supports the acoustic mapping of visual text-signals and thus provides much better accessibility to documents. Finally, for the case of the font size in the typographic layer, we present the results of two quantitative approaches (direct mapping and emotional-based mapping) for the rendering of text signals through DtA.",

Focusing on the tonal dimension of emphasis, we present a robust unit-selection methodology for generating realistic F0 curves in cases where focus prominence is required. The proposed approach is based on selecting Tone-Group units from commonly used prosodic corpora that are automatically transcribed as patterns of syllables. In contrast to related approaches, patterns represent only the most perceivable sections of the sampled curves and are encoded to serve morphologically different sequence of syllables. This results in a minimization of the required amount of units so as to achieve sufficient coverage within the database. Nevertheless, this optimization enables the application of high-quality F0 generation to small \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Document-to-Audio accessibility assumes that all meaningful presentaion elements in the document, such as bold, italics, tables or bullets, should be properly processed and acoustically modeled, in order to convey the intended meaning to the listeners in a complete and adequate manner. Similarly, several types of documents may contain reported speech and dialogue content signaled through punctuation and other visual elements that require further processing before being rendered to speech. This paper explores such dialogue elements in documents, examines their actual indicators and their use, and investigates the most prominent methods for their acoustic modeling, namely the use of prosody manipulation and voice alternation. It further reports on a pilot experiment on the appropriateness of voice alternation as means for the effective spoken rendition of dialogue elements in documents. Results \u2026",

The last part of the paper is dedicated to applications of speech technology for the disabled. The main focus is on blind and partially sighted people and those with hearing loss. Concerning the blind, many multilingual text-to-speech synthesis systems exist, and some polyglot ones, that can convert printed and electronic documents to audio, but further research is needed for structured text, tables and above all graphics to be efficiently transformed into speech.
