The parameter  is positive and measures the width of transition layers generated during phase separation. We also couple the noise strength to this parameter. Using formal asymptotic expansions, we identify the limit. In the right scaling, our results indicate that the stochastic Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation converge to a Hele-Shaw problem with stochastic forcing on the curvature equation. In the case when the noise is sufficiently small, we rigorously prove that the limit is a deterministic Hele-Shaw problem. Finally, we discuss which estimates are necessary in order to extend the rigorous result to larger noise strength.",

Under the appropriate scaling we pass rigorously to the limit by taking into account the motion of the centers and the deformation of the spherical shape. We distinguish between two different cases and we derive the classical mean-field model and another continuum limit corresponding to critical density which can be related to a continuity equation obtained recently by Niethammer andOtto.  So, the theory of Lifshitz, Slyozov, and Wagner is improved by taking into account the geometry of the spatial distribution.",

            "Abstract": "We study an $\\ep$-dependent stochastic Allen--Cahn equation with a mild random noise on a bounded domain in , . Here $\\ep$ is a small positive parameter that represents formally the thickness of the solution interface, while the mild noise $\\xi^\\ep(t)$ is a smooth random function of  of order $\\mathcal O(\\ep^{-\\gamma})$ with  that converges to white noise as $\\ep\\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider initial data that are independent of $\\ep$ satisfying some non-degeneracy conditions, and prove that steep transition layers---or interfaces---develop within a very short time of order $\\ep^2|\\ln\\ep|$, which we call the \"generation of interface\". Next we study the motion of those transition layers and derive a stochastic motion law for the sharp interface limit as $\\ep\\rightarrow 0^+$. Furthermore, we prove that the thickness of the interface for $\\ep$ small is indeed of order $\\mathcal O(\\ep)$ and that the solution profile near the interface remains close to that of a (squeezed) travelling wave, this means that the presence of the noise does not destroy the solution profile near the interface as long as the noise is spatially uniform. Our results on the motion of interface improve the earlier results of Funaki (1999) and Weber (2010) by considerably weakening the requirements for the initial data and establishing the robustness of the solution profile near the interface that has not been known before.",

For the analytical treatment of the corresponding free boundary problem, a new strategy is proposed, based on the introduction of an ad hoc class of disjoining pressures which tend to concentrate at triple junctions. A first investigation of this approach yields the existence of weak solutions which satisfy the dissipation relation as an inequality and which are different from those with zero contact angle. A heuristic argument is also presented in order to clarify the connection between contact angle and dissipation relation: it shows that moving droplets which satisfy the dissipation relation as an equality are forced to have the prescribed contact angle.",

When the parameter \u03f5 is very small, the solution develops a clear transition layer between the region where the u species is dominant and the one where the v species is dominant. As \u03f5 tends to zero, the transition layer becomes a sharp interface, whose motion is subject to a certain law of motion, which is called the \u201cinterface equation\u201d.

Introduction. In this paper, we study the evolution of normal graphs over the unit sphere under volume preserving mean curvature flow (VPMCF). We use a proper diffeomorphism and a general parametrization of the unit sphere. Our main goal is to express evolution as an initial and boundary value problem with periodic conditions for a second order non-linear partial differential equation with non-local integral terms.

            "Abstract": "We prove the existence and uniqueness of pulsating waves for the motion by mean curvature of an n-dimensional hypersurface in an inhomogeneous medium, represented by a periodic forcing. The main difficulty is caused by the degeneracy of the equation and the fact the forcing is allowed to change sign. Under the assumption of weak inhomogeneity, we obtain uniform oscillation and gradient bounds so that the evolving surface can be written as a graph over a reference hyperplane. The existence of an effective speed of propagation is established for any normal direction. We further prove the Lipschitz continuity of the speed with respect to the normal and various stability properties of the pulsating wave. The results are related to the homogenisation of mean curvature flow with forcing.",

The noise is smooth in space and is defined as a Fourier series with independent Brownian motions in time. Motivated by the work of Bates & Xun on slow manifolds for the integrated Cahn-Hilliard equation, our analysis reveals the significant difficulties and differences in comparison with the deterministic problem. New higher order terms, that we estimate, appear due to It\u00f4 calculus and stochastic integration dominating the exponentially slow deterministic dynamics of the interfaces. We derive a first order linear system of stochastic ordinary differential equations approximating the equations of front motion. Furthermore, we prove stochastic stability for the approximate slow manifold of solutions on a very long time scale and evaluate the noise effect.",

We present the rigorous mathematical formulation of this model in a financial setting resulting to an -dimensional outer parabolic Stefan problem with noise. In particular, our aim is to estimate for a short time period the areas of zero trading, and their diameter which approximates the minimum of the  spreads of the portfolio assets for orders from the  limit order books of each asset respectively. In dimensions , and for zero volatility, this problem stands as a mean field model for Ostwald ripening, and has been proposed and analyzed by Niethammer. Therein, when the initial moving boundary consists of well separated spheres, a first order approximation system of odes had been rigorously derived for the dynamics of the interfaces and the asymptotic profile of the solution. In our financial case, we propose a spherical moving boundaries approach where the zero trading area consists of a union of spherical domains centered at portfolios various prices, while each sphere may correspond to a different market; the relevant radii represent the half of the minimum spread. We apply It\\^o calculus and provide second order formal asymptotics for the stochastic version dynamics, written as a system of stochastic differential equations for the radii evolution in time. A second order approximation seems to disconnect the financial model from the large diffusion assumption for the trading density. Moreover, we solve the approximating systems numerically.",
