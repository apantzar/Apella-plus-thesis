The participating sample consisted of Greek students attending the second grade of primary school in Crete. The sample was divided into two groups, which were distributed among an experimental and a control group. The control group was taught following the traditional instruction, according to the pedagogical principles of Curriculum for the second grade of primary school. The experimental group was taught through an ICT-oriented intervention based upon Van Hiele's levels.

However, the rise in popularity of mobile applications (apps) mainly addressed to young children is not in line with a corresponding increase in their quality, as there is conflicting evidence about the real value and suitability of educational apps. The purpose of this study was to examine whether self-proclaimed educational apps for Greek preschoolers have been designed in accordance with developmentally appropriate standards to contribute to the social, emotional and cognitive development of children in formal and informal learning environments. The study results were discouraging. The majority of the apps aimed to teach children the basics about numbers and letters \u2026",

In this context, it is important for preschool teachers to be able to assess each app for its effectiveness in educational practice. To evaluate educational mobile apps, this paper presents a rubric (abbreviated as REVEAC) in four areas: contents, design, functionality, and technical quality, each having multiple aspects. In this paper, we discuss the known problems in using educational apps and we present a review of relevant literature, as well as the process of formulating REVEAC.

The integration of ICT into preschool education has become a high priority for everybody involved in the learning process. The Early Numeracy Test was given to pupils and semi-structured interviews with young children were conducted in 18 preschool classes in Crete. Pupils in the control group received only the traditional science instruction about natural sciences (solubility, recycling) and mathematical concepts (comparison, classification and general nowledge of numbers). Pupils in the experimental group received only the science instruction with the use of ICT for the same topics. Both the experimental and the control groups consisted of classes from the same participating schools. The incorporation of ICT in early year\u2019s classes in Greece should be considered as a means of an obligatory modernization of learning and teaching methods. The results of our research showed that teaching and learning through ICT as an innovative teaching method can be successful for understanding the concept of numbers and natural sciences phenomena at preschool level.",

            "Abstract": "New ICT tools allow children to take advantage of new learning platforms as well aiding them effectively in attaining new knowledge through activities related to their immediate interests and real life scenarios. Nowadays, computers and digital applications are a part of the daily life of children. In kindergarten education, properly designed digital educational activities can become a very powerful educational tool for efficient and effective learning. The utilization of interactive activities may contribute towards the growth of learning incentives as well as proper mental development in particular areas; such as mathematics and science. Mobile devices have new attractive features and provide considerable advantages in the teaching of mathematics in kindergarten education. Our study proposes the integration of mobile devices, running our own specially designed learning activity applications, in kindergarten classrooms. These applications are based on the three levels of Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) targeting fundamental mathematical concepts for the kindergarten level. We intend to gather information on effectiveness of the incorporation of these devices and applications as leaning tools for kindergarteners.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the impact on kindergarten children\u2019s mathematical competence after the implementation of a software application for counting and calculating with tablet computers. The application consisted of some counting and calculation activities, designed following the background of realistic mathematics education and more specifically that of the learning teaching trajectory for the domain of counting and calculation. Four kindergarten schools of Heraklion participated in the study, which was conducted during spring 2017. The research followed the pre-test and post-test model, using the Early Numeracy Test (ENT), an instrument measuring the early mathematical competence. The test comprises of questions for the concepts of comparison, classification, correspondence, seriation, using counting words, structured counting, resultative counting, and general knowledge of numbers. The results of the study support a positive correlation between children\u2019s early numeracy competence and the integration of tablet computers in teaching and learning numbers.",

The participants of this research were drawn from teachers of public schools in the area of Athens and Crete (Greece). A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire with 30 questions designed to assess attitudes of teachers toward computers and their computer knowledge in primary schools learning environment. Varimax with Kaiser Normalization was applied to extract the main five factors of kindergarten teachers' attitudes. Also, a three 2-way MANOVA was performed between the kindergarten and primary school teachers to see the interactions of these main factors on: a) the ICT knowledge of teachers, b) the frequency of using ICT at home by the teachers and, c) the ICT use in the teaching process. Finally, the changes in the main factors of kindergarten and primary school teachers were \u2026",

In an attempt to increase interest in computer science (CS), there has been made much effort in developing tools and activities as preliminary learning materials in schools and universities. App Inventor and Scratch strive to engage the novice users by allowing them to write programs about things that connect with their interests in contrast to more conventional programming. In this paper, we focus on the use of these two block-based programming environments as tools to facilitate learning programming for novices. In our analysis, both novice programming environments (NPEs) seemed to be attractive platforms for introducing fundamental concepts in computer programming and both look appealing \u2026",
