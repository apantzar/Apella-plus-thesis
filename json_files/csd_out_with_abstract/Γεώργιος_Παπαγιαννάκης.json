            "Abstract": "Virtual Worlds [MK94] and their concept of cyber-real space interplay invoke such interactive digital narratives that promote new patterns of understanding. However, the \"narrative\" and \"interactive\" part, which refers to a set of events happening during a certain period of time and providing aesthetic, dramaturgical and emotional elements, objects and attitudes ([NM00], [TYK01]) is still an early topic of research. Mixing such aesthetic ambiences with interactive virtual character augmentations [CMM*03] and adding dramatic tension has developed very recently these narrative patterns into an exciting new edutainment medium [LHM03]. With the interplay of a modern real-time framework for integrated interactive virtual character simulation, we can enhance the experience with full virtual character simulations.",

            "Abstract": "Background: Although the proper use of hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount for preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, health care personnel have been shown to use incorrect techniques for donning/doffing of PPE and hand hygiene, leading to a large number of infections among health professionals. Education and training are difficult owing to the social distancing restrictions in place, shortages of PPE and testing material, and lack of evidence on optimal training. Virtual reality (VR) simulation can offer a multisensory, 3-D, fully immersive, and safe training opportunity that addresses these obstacles.Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the short-and long-term effectiveness of a fully immersive VR simulation versus a traditional learning method regarding a COVID-19\u2013related skill set and media-specific variables influencing training outcomes.Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study on medical students (N= 29; intervention VR training, n= 15, vs control video-based instruction, n= 14) to compare the performance of hand disinfection, nasopharyngeal swab taking, and donning/doffing of PPE before and after training and 1 month later as well as variables of media use.Results: Both groups performed significantly better after training, with the effect sustained over one month. After training, the VR group performed significantly better in taking a nasopharyngeal swab, scoring a median of 14 out of 17 points (IQR 13-15) versus 12 out of 17 points (IQR 11-14) in the control group, P=. 03. With good immersion and tolerability of the VR simulation, satisfaction was significantly \u2026",

The resulting animation, generated in real-time, is a blend of key animations provided a priori by the animator. The blending is done with the help of efficient dual-quaternion transformation blending. The user\u2019s point of view is tracked using either computer vision techniques or a simple user-controlled input modality, such as mouse-based input. This tracked point of view is then used to suitably select the blend of animations. We show a way to author and use such animations in both virtual as well as augmented reality scenarios and demonstrate that it significantly heightens the sense of presence for the users when \u2026",

To date, that has been an \u201cover there\u201d experience, leaving a physical gap that reminds our senses that we\u2019re not truly immersed. But that\u2019s beginning to change, thanks to the advent of modern Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, otherwise termed together as Mixed Reality (MR). Just within the last two years, there has been a great leap forward in immersion and VR/AR techniques and h/w enabling technologies. Along the way we\u2019ve discovered that VR/AR is not just for entertainment\u2014gaming and movies, for example\u2014but that it also has broad commercial applications for the likes of virtual travel and very recently smart education on both mobile and desktop devices. Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming an increasingly \u201chot\u201d topic nowadays, with the development and introduction of various VR headsets by a few different vendors such as the Google-Cardboard HMD. One of their shortcomings is the absence of traditional navigation and interaction controls. In this work we employ a secondary mobile device for six degrees of freedom interaction (translation and rotation) using the screen as well as the embedded mobile sensors in a virtual museum application.",

To do so, it will draw on recent findings emerging from the fields of applied psychology, neuroaesthetics and cognitive literary studies; and consider a case study advancing the use of literary travel narratives in the design of DCH applications for Antiquities - in this case the well-known ancient Greek monument of Acropolis. Subsequently, the chapter will discuss how Literary-based MR Presence shifts public reception from an education-entertainment-touristic consumption paradigm to a response predicated on valuation. It will show that this type of public engagement is more closely aligned both with MR applications' default mode of usership, and with newly emerging conceptions of a user-centered museum (e.g., the Museum 3.0), thus providing a Virtual Museum model expressly suited to cultural heritage.",

That synthesized world termed Augmented Reality allows seeing the real scene with virtual augmentations superimposed onto it, but often fails to produce a realtime image that as a whole is a believable integrated experience. Furthermore, often Virtual Reality cultural heritage reconstructions are not physically correct rendered in real-time.

The workshop was prepared by Dietmar Hildenbrand, Eckhard Hitzer and George Papagiannakis (who also served as chair of CGI 2016). This special issue of AACA is mainly based on extended contributions to the GACSE 2016 workshop and covers topics ranging from applications of Clifford Geometric Algebra (GA) in computer graphics, computer vision and robotics to topics related to computing with and theory of GA. The applications in computer graphics and computer vision apply Conformal Geometric Algebra in the areas of binocular computer vision, object detection in point clouds, construction of Voronoi diagrams, geometric modeling, motor estimation and a code generator comparison for virtual character simulation. While the inverse kinematics of robots is also using Conformal Geometric Algebra, the six-dimensional Euclidean Geometric Algebra G6= Cl (6, 0) is used for mobility analysis and singularity analysis of mechanisms.The computing topics of this special issue cover a new co-processor design, an optimized implementation using binary trees, as well as proposals for C++ implementations of Geometric Algebra for the purpose of big data processing. An extension of Conformal Geometric Algebra to Double Conformal Geometric Algebra for treating quadrics and Dupin-and Darboux cyclides is explained in the mathematical part, together with solutions to minimum residual and quaternionic matrix \u2026",

            "Abstract": "More and more we can see several ancient sites simulated with 3D technologies. The presented case studies will illustrate the virtual reconstruction methodology and techniques we applied for the virtual restitution of historical sites such as Pompeii in Italy, using AR, or the Great Mosque of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (using VR). But what is more interesting today is to mix some real scenery with virtual scenery. In the case of Pompeii, we have simulated life including humans, animals and plants together with the existing remaining building. This requires filming the natural decor and augmenting it at the right place with virtual humans. For doing that, we had also to analyze the costumes and the hairstyles, the behavior and the interaction between people living at that particular time. In our presentation, we will describe our real-time virtual human\u2019s platform that allows us to see Pompeii augmented and to walk through the theater Aspendos in Turkey, seeing in the same time people that use to live there or be at these places. We will explain the methods used to simulate real-time clothes, hair and animation of the virtual humans. We also describe the rendering method that should consider the real light and the calculated light and visual case studies are shown.",

In this paper, we focus on the evolution of our algorithms and their integration towards improving the presence and interactivity of virtual characters in real and virtual environments, as we realize the transition from mobile workstations to ultra-mobile PC's. We examine in detail three crucial parts of such systems: user-tracked interaction; real-time, automatic, adaptable animation of virtual characters and deformable pre-computed radiance transfer illumination for virtual characters. We examine our efforts to enhance the sense of presence for the user, while maintaining the quality of animation and interactivity as we scale and deploy our AR framework in a variety of platforms. We examine different AR virtual human enhanced scenarios under the different mobile devices that illustrate the interplay and applications of our methods.",

Inspired by a hermeneutical approach, this case study illustrates that the abandonment of traditional concepts of static cultural artefacts with interactive, augmented historical character-based narrative representations, can propel virtual reconstructions of cultural heritage sites to an exciting new edutainment medium. Furthermore, as the cultural tradition is conceived as a reservoir of living forces that can be experienced only if it is freed from the petrifaction exerted during the centuries, a reconstruction and real-time immersive visualisation is presented that captures such \u2018living forces\u2019 by simulating these edifices both as churches (original form) and as mosques, fully respecting the archaeological, historical and architectural premises. Instrumental to that approach is the rapid realtime immersive 3D application prototyping, that it is feasible only due to the adoption a component-based real-time framework for VR character simulation.",

In order to enhance both simulated 3D environments, either case study presents the inclusion of real time animated virtual humans, which are re-enacting situations and activities that were typically performed in such sites during ancient times. Furthermore, the implemented modeling and real time illumination strategies of both the textured static 3D models of the sites and the simulated dynamic virtual humans are equally presented and compared.",

To that end, this paper proposes an approach for their visualization in Virtual Environments, within which the practitioner is represented by a Virtual Human, their actions through animations resulting from Motion Capture recordings, and objects through their 3D reconstructions. Our novel approach is based on a conceptual, twofold decomposition of craft processes into actions, and of the machines used into components. Thus, in the context of this paper, we have developed a pipeline that delivers a Virtual Environment, through which a wide range of users, from museum curators and exhibitors, to everyday users interested by a craft, can experience craft usage scenarios. Via our visualization pipeline, we claim that we deliver an efficient way of visualizing craft processes within Virtual Environments, thus increasing the usability and educational value of craft representation, and opening the way to a variety of new applications for craft presentation, education and thematic tourism. In the scope of this paper, we focus on the Heritage Craft of loom weaving; however, our approach is generic, for representing any craft, after its decomposition according to our technique.",

However, to replace existing nonpharmaceutical treatment training protocols, VR platforms need significant improvement if they are to appeal to older people with symptoms of cognitive decline and meet their specific needs.This study aims to design and test the acceptability, usability, and tolerability of an immersive VR platform that allows older people with MCI symptoms to simultaneously practice physical and cognitive skills on a dual task.On the basis of interviews with 20 older people with MCI symptoms (15 females; mean age 76.25, SD 5.03 years) and inputs from their health care providers (formative study VR1), an interdisciplinary group of experts developed a VR system called VRADA (VR Exercise App for Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s Patients). Using an identical training protocol, the VRADA system was first tested with a group of 30 university students (16 females; mean age 20.86, SD 1.17 years) and then with 27 older people (19 females; mean age 73.22, SD 9.26 years) who had been diagnosed with MCI (feasibility studies VR2a and VR2b).

            "Abstract": "Applications of the Extended Reality (XR) spectrum, a superset of Mixed, Augmented and Virtual Reality, are gaining prominence and can be employed in a variety of areas, such as virtual museums. Examples can be found in the areas of education, cultural heritage, health/treatment, entertainment, marketing, and more. The majority of computer graphics applications nowadays are used to operate only in one of the above realities. The lack of applications across the XR spectrum is a real shortcoming. There are many advantages resulting from this problem's solution. Firstly, releasing an application across the XR spectrum could contribute in discovering its most suitable reality. Moreover, an application could be more immersive within a particular reality, depending on its context. Furthermore, its availability increases to a broader range of users. For instance, if an application is released both in Virtual and Augmented Reality, it is accessible to users that may lack the possession of a VR headset, but not of a mobile AR device. The question that arises at this point, would be \"Is it possible for a full s/w application stack to be converted across XR without sacrificing UI/UX in a semi-automatic way?\". It may be quite difficult, depending on the architecture and application implementation. Most companies nowadays support only one reality, due to their lack of UI/UX software architecture or resources to support the complete XR spectrum. In this work, we present an \"automatic reality transition\" in the context of virtual museum applications. We propose a development framework, which will automatically allow this XR transition.

Our described framework thus provides a) a procedural keyframe generator for realistic idle motions blended with the virtual actor's scripted behavior and b) an extension to precomputed radiance transfer for multi-segmented hierarchies for global illumination for real-time. Thus on one hand the visual discrepancy between the actor's dynamic illumination model and the environment static high dynamic range lightmaps is greatly minimized; on the other hand, once the virtual actors complete their speech, they continue realistic subtle body motions in a non-repetitive manner, waiting for their next verse instead of stopping in a specific pose. Our case study on verses of ancient Greek tragedies in the virtually restituted ancient theatre of Aspendos illustrates the above integrated algorithms and overall methodology.",

However, limited time and resources within healthcare systems make the provision of stress relief interventions difficult to provide. Research has shown that provision of preoperative stress relief and educational resources can improve health outcomes and speed recovery. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be a valuable tool in providing stress relief and educational support to patients and family before but also after an operation, enabling better self-management and self-empowerment. To this direction, this paper reports on the design of a novel technical infrastructure for a resilience support tool for improving the health condition of patients, during the care path, using Virtual Reality (VR). The designed platform targets, among others, at improving the knowledge on the patient data, effectiveness and adherence to treatment, as well as providing for effective communication channels between patients and clinicians.",

The goal of this article is to describe the techniques used in order to achieve a photo-realistic simulation of the selected space and its characters, as well as to point out the challenges and solutions that such a work implies at different stages in production. Most of these issues are mainly focused on the reconstruction of the architecture of the site, but in order to achieve an accurate simulation the social aspect must not be forgotten. The importance of a heritage site resides as well in the historical characters and the social interactions that were taking place there: this information allows a better understanding of the function and the importance of the selected site in connection with the cultural aspects of the life at a certain time. In order to strengthen the feeling of immersion in a heritage edifice virtually restituted, it is important to recreate virtual life and describe the timely evolutionary aspects of the edifice as well.",

We integrated in our open-source VR framework both latest experimental Oculus Rift HMDs (DK1 and DK2) together with the Emotiv EPOC mobile EEG headset in an innovative, open architecture for user position, orientation and brainwave frequency tracking. We carried out a novel experiment with five groups tracking the brain frequency states of people while relaxing or performing certain sensorimotor tasks in an interactive, immersive 3D environment. The primary aim of this novel research is human cognition augmentation and improvement of task performance via a unique VR-induced entrainment methodology. In most of our experimental groups, we witnessed the transition of the beta-wave to the alpha-wave state. The brainwave entrainment at alpha frequency (10Hz) and relaxation via modern VR, using our open s/w framework, allowed us to verify for the first time enhanced task performance in a fast-learning setup. These first results empower us to plan future studies concerning clinical treatments in VR entrainment using modern wearable devices.",

            "Abstract": "The primary mission of cultural institutions, including heritage sites and museums, is to perform and perpetuate Cultural Heritage (CH) by ideally transforming audiences into stewards of that heritage. In recent years, these institutions have increasingly turned to Mixed Reality (MR) technologies to expand and democratize public access to Cultural Heritage\u2014a trend that is called upon to accelerate with COVID-19\u2014because these technologies provide opportunities for more remote outreach, and moreover, can make partial remains or ruins more relatable to the public. But as emerging evaluations indicate, existing MR intangible and tangible Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) applications are largely proving inadequate to engaging audiences beyond an initial fascination with the immersive 3D visualization of heritage sites and artefacts owing in part to misguided storytelling or non-compelling narratives. They fail to effectively communicate the significance of Cultural Heritage to audiences and impress upon them its value in a lasting way due to their overreliance on an education-entertainment-touristic consumption paradigm. Building on the recent case made for Literature-based MR Presence, this article examines how the literary tradition of travel narratives can be recruited to enhance presence and embodiment, and further elicit aesthetic experiences in Digital Cultural Heritage applications by drawing on recent findings from the fields of Extended Reality (XR), cognitive literary science and new museology. The projected effects of this innovative approach are not limited to an increase in audience engagement on account of a greater sense of \u2026",

The resulting AR system allows us to produce complex rendering and animation of virtual human characters, and to blend them into the real world. The system tracks the 3D camera position by means of a natural features tracker, which, given a rough CAD model, can deal with complex 3D objects. The tracking method can handle both large camera displacements and aspect changes. We will show that our system works in the cluttered environment of a real industrial facility and can, therefore, be used to enhance manufacturing and industrial processes.",

            "Abstract": "It is well known that the Decadent movement in European literature (fin de si\u00e8cle) depends on the narrative of the antiquity, as it is revealed from the discoveries of archaeology in the second half of the 19th century. Amid the ruins of the past authors, painters and poets re-conceptualize time and history through a modernist vision based on an imaginary reconfiguration of the antiquity. In this context, the myth of a city (Pompeii) or of a woman (Salom\u00e9) offer examples, which would illustrate in a great variety the synergy of a multi-temporal and multi-cultural memory of the myth. In this paper we identify a \"content-based\" shortcoming of modern Mixed Reality (MR) intangible and tangible digital heritage storytelling applications for digital humanities. It is an important problem as the very nature of these applications is often been identified with either misguided storytelling, or non-compelling, non-engaging narratives, except the initial captivating moments due to the immersive 3D visual simulation. We propose a new concept that forthcoming MR applications can draw from: \"Literature-based MR Presence\". Based on modern literature excerpts associated with the real heritage sites, digital narratives can achieve new depths of Presence (phenomenon of behaving and feeling as if we are in the virtual/augmented world created by computerized displays). They would evoke deeper sensations if their dramaturgical plots were based on literary texts associated with the heritage sites, from users, as similar to those often associated with cognitive presence, e.g. when someone is feeling of being transported in an alternate reality when simply reading a compelling \u2026",

Virtual reality (VR) is a 3D computer simulated environment that gives to user the experience of being physically present in real or computer-generated worlds; on the other hand, augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical environment whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory inputs. Both technologies use interactive devices to achieve the optimum adaptation of the user in the immersive world achieving enhanced presence, harnessing latest advances in computer vision, glasses or head-mounted-displays featuring embedded mobile devices. A common issue in all of them is interpolation \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a simple and robust Mixed Reality (MR) framework that allows for real-time interaction with Virtual Humans in real and virtual environments under consistent illumination. We will look at three crucial parts of this interface system: interaction, animation and global illumination of virtual humans for an integrated and enhanced presence and believability. The interaction system comprises of a dialogue module, which is interfaced with a speech recognition and synthesis system. Next to speech output, the dialogue system generates face and body motions, which are in turn managed by the virtual human animation layer. Our fast animation engine can handle various types of motions, such as normal keyframe animations, or motions that are generated on-the-fly by adapting previously recorded clips. All these different motions are generated and blended on-line, resulting in a flexible and realistic animation. Our robust rendering method operates in accordance with the previous animation layer, based on an extended for virtual humans Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) illumination model (Sloan et al., 2002), resulting in a realistic display of such interactive virtual characters in mixed reality environments. Finally, we present a scenario that illustrates the interplay and application of our methods, glued under a unique framework (Papagiannakis et al., 2005) for presence and interaction in MR.",

For example, for a real-time performance it is highly desirable to lighten the geometry and optimize the runtime animation of characters wherever possible. An important need in such systems is to assist the CG artists in seamlessly transforming their modeling work from CG packages to the real-time application, without limiting their expressivity. In this paper we describe techniques by which dressed human characters are modeled, loaded into VR scenes, and simulated in real-time. In doing so, we point out challenging issues and solutions that such tasks imply at each phase of modeling and simulation. In particular, we turn our attention to what we consider as key technical components: body and \u2026",

Usually to synthesize motion, short motion segments are concatenated into longer sequences by finding transitions at points where character poses are similar. If similarity is only a measure of posture correlation, without consideration for the stylistic variations of movement, the resulting motion might have unnatural discontinuities. Particularly prone to this problem are highly stylized motions, such as dance performances. This work presents a motion analysis framework, based on Laban Movement Analysis, that also accounts for stylistic variations of the movement.

However, not all the existing prototypes of AR systems can be used in an industrial environment due to heavy constraints such as low robustness or cumbersome equipment. Our AR system relies purely on passive techniques to solve the real-time registration problem, and it can run on a portable computer. We combined a powerful virtual reality (VR) componentbased simulation framework with computer vision techniques, turning it into an AR system. The resulting system allows us to produce complex rendering and animation of avatars, and blend them into the real world. The system tracks the 3D camera position by means of a natural features tracker, which, given a rough CAD model, can deal with complex 3D objects. The tracking method is robust and can handle large camera displacements and aspect changes. The target applications of our AR system are industrial maintenance, repair and training. The tracking robustness makes the AR system able to work in real environments, such as industrial facilities, and not only in the laboratory.",

Previous work already established that young children can learn programming basics. Yet, there is still a need to investigate whether this capability can be transferred in the context of IEs, since encouraging children to participate in the management of their intelligent surroundings can enhance responsibility, independence, and the spirit of cooperation. We performed a user study (N=15) with children aged 7-12, using a block-based, gamified AR spatial coding prototype allowing to manipulate smart artifacts in an Intelligent Living room. Our results validated that children understand and can indeed program IEs. Based on our findings, we contribute preliminary implications regarding the use of specific technologies and paradigms (e.g. AR, trigger-action programming) to inspire future systems that enable children to create enriching experiences in IEs.",

A rich media storytelling case study is used as an example for illustrating the effects of introduction of virtual characters in mobile AR. Although presence is strengthened, believability is not keeping its pace, due to limited interaction between the real participants and the virtual characters, as part of limitations of mobile technology. In this work we are addressing the issues of creating interactive applications for mobile MR, in order to deliver \u2018real\u2019experiences. We argue that future steps in mobile MR enabling technologies should cater for enhanced social awareness of the virtual humans to the real world and new channels for interactivity between the real users and virtual actors.

            "Abstract": "Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) is a framework that allows the representation of objects, such as points, planes and spheres, and deformations, such as translations, rotations and dilations as uniform vectors, called multivectors. In this work, we demonstrate the merits of multivector usage with a novel, integrated rigged character simulation framework based on CGA. In such a framework, and for the first time, one may perform real-time cuts and tears as well as drill holes on a rigged 3D model. These operations can be performed before and/or after model animation, while maintaining deformation topology. Moreover, our framework permits generation of intermediate keyframes on-the-fly based on user input, apart from the frames provided in the model data. We are motivated to use CGA as it is the lowest-dimension extension of dual-quaternion algebra that amends the shortcomings of the majority of existing animation and deformation techniques. Specifically, we no longer need to maintain objects of multiple algebras and constantly transmute between them, such as matrices, quaternions and dual-quaternions, and we can effortlessly apply dilations. Using such an all-in-one geometric framework allows for better maintenance and optimization and enables easier interpolation and application of all native deformations. Furthermore, we present these three novel algorithms in a single CGA representation which enables cutting, tearing and drilling of the input rigged model, where the output model can be further re-deformed in interactive frame rates. These close to real-time cut,tear and drill algorithms can enable a new suite of applications \u2026",

Such applications can be beneficial for future museums, as with True AR, 3D models of various exhibits, monuments, statues,",

Because of this inherently interdisciplinary character, VR domain can be viewed as a melting pot of various technologies which although complementary are non-trivial to put together. Frameworks can be used to address this challenge as they offer advantages such as reusability of components, as well as ease of replacements, extensions, and adaptations. Hence, this paper presents developments within the EPOCH project, in particular the Characterize NEWTON, to improve and release frameworks that support the incorporation of avatars in interactive real-time 3D VR systems. The purpose is to enable avatars to be interactive and to react to model metadata; thus adding realism and engaging the user\u2019s interest. This vertical middleware offers the advantage to be based on open source generic frameworks, such as OpenSceneGraph and OpenSG as well as offering complementary functionalities.",

One of the primary concerns of the designers of such environments is to model the interaction of the virtual characters with the users. The gaze of the virtual character forms a chief component of this interaction. When the gaze of the virtual character is directed correctly towards the users, they perceive a sense of presence inside the virtual environment, during their interactions with the virtual character. We present, in this paper, a simple idea to control the gaze of a virtual character based on the viewpoint of the user involved in the interaction, suitable both for Virtual Reality as well as Augmented Reality applications.

The purpose of using CGA is to lift several restrictions posed by current state-of-the-art character animation & deformation methods. Previous implementations originally required weighted matrices to perform deformations, whereas, in the current state-of-the-art, dual-quaternions handle both rotations and translations, but cannot handle dilations. CGA is a suitable extension of dual-quaternion algebra that amends these two major previous shortcomings: the need to constantly transmute between matrices and dual-quaternions as well as the inability to properly dilate a model during animation. Our CGA algorithm also provides easy interpolation and application of all \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Gamification of virtual reality (VR) experiences is a topic of research that has been particularly intensified with the advent or recent VR h/w, such as, low-cost, high field-of-view head-mounted displays (HMDs). The main novelty of this work lies in the investigation and comparison of different s/w human-computer interaction methodologies for real-time VR simulation of both tangible and intangible digital heritage sites and the creation of dedicated, immersive, gamified curation experiences. Important conclusions are drawn since for the first time, VR is finally becoming a mass consumer product that will be delivering more and more convincing interactive experiences with elevated feeling of Presence for Digital Humanities. Based on recent specific software 3D platforms and 3D content creation pipelines, digital heritage environments can benefit immensely from such versatile, efficient and robust prototyping VR human \u2026",

Our vision is to make the user the multimedia center: the user as the point at which multimedia services and the means for interacting with them converge. This paper proposes the main research goals in providing users with a personalized interface and content independent of physical networked devices, and space and time. As a case study, we describe an indoors, mobile mixed reality guide system: Chloe@University. With a see-through head-mounted display (HMD) connected to a small wearable computing device, Chloe@University provides users with an efficient way to guide someone in a building.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we present our work on the LIFEPLUS EU IST project. LIFEPLUS proposes an innovative 3D reconstruction of ancient frescos-paintings through the real-time revival of their fauna and flora, featuring groups of virtual animated characters with artificial life dramaturgical behaviors, in an immersive AR environment. The goal of this project is to push the limits of current Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, exploring the processes of narrative design of fictional spaces where users can experience a high degree of realistic interactive immersion. Based on a captured/real-time video of a real scene, the project is oriented in enhancing these scenes by allowing the possibility to render realistic 3D simulations of virtual characters in real-time. Although initially targeted at Cultural Heritage Centers and Sites, the paradigm is by no means limited to such subjects, but encompasses all types of future Location-Based Entertainments, E-visitor Attractions, e-Worker training schemes as well as on-set visualizations for the TV/movie industry. In this paper we provide an overview of the project and the technologies being employed and finally we present early results based on the ongoing research.",

            "Abstract": "We describe a new methodology for 3D photo realistic reconstruction and real-time simulation of complex heritage edifices, using widely available standard tools. The aim is to build compelling, interactive and highly realistic virtual cultural reconstructions, as their static lighting is based on premium precalculated lighting data. This data is obtained by the use of appealing photo realistic lighting models, such as the Radiosity global illumination technique. The resulting high-quality lighting information is stored in 2D textures, called light maps, which according to the multi-pass multi-texture technique, are blended in real-time with the model ordinary texture maps. The real-time experience is also accompanied with an integrated atmospheric simulation based on particle systems. The whole methodology is based on international open standard programming languages and APIs, while leaving the user to freely select and \u2026",

In order to establish a coherent taxonomy, specific elements characterizing such approaches will be discussed and employed to assist the definition of a general conceptual framework that will enable the classification of the possible design choices according to their specific characteristics. Finally, a selection of modeling and simulation techniques which are specifically related to the creation process underlying the virtual representation of heritage items by means of modern visualization technologies will be explored alongside the main areas of preferences linked to the major actors active in the cultural heritage field.",
