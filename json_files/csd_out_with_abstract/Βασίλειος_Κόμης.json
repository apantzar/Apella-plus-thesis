            "Abstract": "ResultsFigure 1 shows the sequential programming structure (3 steps process: memory, movement (s), execution) of the Logo-like robotic environment linked to different categories of errors. The category of syntax errors led children/programmers to debug since control commands are involved for a program to run. For the logical errors category, most errors were described as lack of direction and orientation commands. A few cases characterized as semantic errors and related to the misconception of guidance commands. The range of qualitative categories brought to light that children/programmers are primarily developing strategies for debugging experienced programmers such as creating a new program (Sipitakiat & Nusen, 2012). Between the two ages, older children/programmers (5-6 year old) present an established programming behaviour where they recognise and identify syntax and semantic/logical errors and applying appropriate debugging strategy to fix them.",

The survey was administered in Greece to a total of 1165 primary and secondary education teachers, just after they had completed a training programme on basic ICT skills. The majority of the teachers in the sample stated positively towards the role that ICT could play in education. However, only a small percentage of them have adopted and use ICT in their instruction job. Our findings have also revealed some interfering factors, which make many teachers cautious or skeptical about ICT integration in the educational practice. We have also recorded differences in teachers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions according to their gender and subject specialty. Finally, we conclude with some implications, which could be helpful to the educational policy authorities in their attempt to implement new initiatives aiming at teachers\u2019 preparation to effectively integrate ICT in their everyday classroom practice.",

This is a case study involving 337 students who attended an academic course based upon a blended learning approach over three years using Moodle. Eighteen variables depicting the students\u2019 perceptions of Moodle, as well as their interaction with it, were examined using four complementary data mining and statistical analysis approaches: visualisation, decision trees, class association rules and clustering. The analysis of the collected data shows that failure in the course was associated with negative attitudes and perceptions of the students towards Moodle. On the other hand excellent grades were associated with increased use of the LCMS. Requirements elicitation of a learning analytics dashboard, are also discussed.",

It discusses the integration of education robotics principles and algorithmic and programming concepts in order to conceive, design and evaluate educational scenarios (didactic sequences). It then proposes a conceptual framework for designing educational scenarios that integrate programmable toys as a guide to teaching programming concepts. A descriptive analysis of the implementation of educational scenarios by in-service early childhood teachers in typical classrooms covers methodological issues emerging from this framework. Furthermore, it provides research results to encompass the conception and designing of educational scenarios in early childhood educational contexts concerning robotics.",

This is particularly the case in recent times that these Institutions strive for resources as cuts and austerity measures affect public education. Yet in Greece, in the middle of a major economic crisis the Open Courseware project was implemented as a large scale action aiming at development of open courses in many Greek Universities. The University of Patras was particularly active in this. It develops a large number of open courses by the end of 2015 in many different disciplines. The lessons learned during the process are discussed in this paper, with main focus on technological and organizational problems and pitfalls, faculty reservations and attitudes, often found in Universities with similar characteristics.",

This relatively new area of research requires new methodological approaches of interaction and problem solving analysis. Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called \u201cObject-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)\u201d is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a reversed view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are \u2018owned\u2019 by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development \u2026",

An innovative aspect of the framework is the association of tasks to artifacts (tools) engaged by the users during the activity. The typical use of this framework is in interactive systems evaluation and design. The framework and the tools functionality are described in the paper. The framework is inspired by the Activity Theory perspective, which recognizes the importance of artifacts, actors and the context in which an activity takes place.",

A study has been contacted in the frame of an authentic educational activity in a Greek secondary school. The students involved were provided with sets of primitive resources of varying degrees of heterogeneity to be used during collaborative modelling activities. Analysis of students peer interaction and produced solutions revealed that, contrary to our expectations, the group with heterogeneous resources produced solutions of similar quality to that of the reference group that possessed homogeneous learning material, while they were more active, exchanged more messages, were involved in deeper discussions and overall collaborated in great extend. The reported findings can have implications in the design of education scenarios involving distance real-time collaboration.",

This involves moving from the perception of real world phenomena to constructing and exploring qualitative and quantitative relations that hold among the main elements.

In this paper, we present tools and activities that attempt to bridge the gap between the physical world experience and the abstract modeling and reasoning phase. Firstly, we discuss a modeling approach and the various representations involved. Then, we present the Video2Frames tool of ModellingSpace which is proposed to be used in order to create educational material by allowing the creation of abstract entities from video recordings of phenomena.

            "Abstract": "Analysis of collaborative problem solving involves analysis of dialogue and interaction, analysis of tasks and social roles through ethnographic and other field studies. Use of tools to facilitate this process can be very useful. We discuss first the key requirements of a new generation of interaction and collaboration analysis tools. We then present how these requirements have lead to the design of prototype tools, recently developed. These tools can relate and synchronize various streams of field data. An important characteristic of the tools is their support for a multilayer structure of annotations of various levels of abstraction, through which the activity can be interpreted and presented.",

It has been found that it is possible to design learning activities with group sizes greater than two and that the group size affects performance and interaction. It was discovered that group skill balance in particular is an important aspect in this context. Therefore, the designer of such activities should design carefully the activity in order to get most benefits from the collaborative setting.",

The approach to the discourse was carried out using quality analysis of texts in the journal \u201cContemporary Education\u201d through the use of a specialized methodological tool. The results of the analysis revealed that until the middle of the period being examined, there was a strong tendency to adopt attitudes that claimed that the integration of ICTs would bring about and/or should bring about minimal change, while in recent years attitudes which adopt the perspective of real influence of ICTs in the change in teaching practices have started to increase.",

            "Abstract": "In this study we focused on the identification of factors involved in the cohesion of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) groups. We operationalised cohesion as the forces that keep the group together and the links between group and members. We explored the perceptions of players through a mixed methods research approach, combining qualitative data from interviews and quantitative data from a survey. Our main findings involve the identification of social and achievement oriented factors relevant to the cohesion of the group. Social factors were relevant to the social and interpersonal relations among members, and the identification with the ideology and interests of the other members. Achievement oriented factors involved the benefits of the group for the achievement of the players' own individual goals and progress in the game, the accomplishment of group tasks, the help and support from the group, the quality of collaboration, participation in decision-making processes, justice, and fair distribution of the rewards. We further compared group cohesion with the satisfaction of the players by their groups. Our findings suggest that group cohesion and satisfaction are strongly related. Group cohesion is particularly critical for the development of a common knowledge space and the emergence of effective collaborative learning processes. The implications of this study involve the design elements that could promote cohesion in virtual environments, or the indications to be monitored by educators or coordinators employing gamebased learning, for further timely interventions, so that a learning and gaming experience can be supported and \u2026",

Interaction analysis is central in the study of CSCL activities, since in such activities through interactions between partners the state of evolving group knowledge is communicated. This interaction is facilitated by tools that allow logging of events that take place, capturing thus information about the content and the process of collaboration. Automated analysis techniques of this information can be developed. The objective of this analysis is often to support participants, in several ways: explicitly, by providing feedback to them in order to regulate their practices, or by making adaptive changes to some aspects of the collaborative setting; or implicitly, by making available to them representations of their activities.

The researchers in the field of Educational Technology are content to build conceptual frameworks to study the cognitive representations formed by the students in this new technological platform and the students' knowledge acquisition. Moreover, they provide the students with virtual environment applications for learning in various domains. Such an approach to the study of learning is presented here, concerning the investigation and evaluation of factors that seem to be important and particularly decisive for the spatial perception. The learners were engaged with specific tasks inside an interactive 3D virtual space modelled using desktop virtual reality technology for learning. The experimental processes that were designed provided our research team with useful data and first conclusions for further research.",

Numerous experiments for use in physics instruction are provided using different pedagogical tools. The paradigm described here adopts a socio-constructivist approach, where the student takes an active role in the construction of his knowledge, and it exploits three different media: a video in order to motivate students\u2019 interest; objects from everyday life for the experiments; the technology-based learning environment \u201cModellingSpace\u201d, which emphasize qualitative understanding, semi-quantitative understanding, requiring written explanations and cooperative learning.

The main objectives are: (1) to investigate other ideas or difficulties, which intervene and determine students' mental models about motion and force, and (2) to reveal how the students in the sample are grouped according to their alternative conceptions. Our study has been mainly determined by the revision in Science Curriculum established in Greece three years ago.

We identified skills and qualities that are relevant not only to the gaming skills of the players but also to their personality, behavior, attitudes, and relations with others. These findings further suggest that MMOGs constitute designed environments and also communities with their own rules and expectations from the players.

Twenty preschool teachers took part in this study: nine who do not use ICT and eleven, who do use them for teaching mathematics. Data were collected with semi-structured interviews and analyzed using the thematic content analysis method. Results indicate that preschool teachers, who use ICT in teaching mathematics, teach mathematical concepts such as spatio-temporal, orientation, classification, matching, serializations, quantities, mathematical operations, patterns, comparisons, volume, shapes, and size. Moreover, despite the benefits of ICT observed by teachers of both groups, but mainly from the one using ICT, the overall use of ICT in the teaching of mathematics is obsoleted. The main barriers of ICT integration, according to preschool teachers are the lack of training on its integration and the preschool teachers\u2019 role during the teaching of mathematics. Implications for in-service teacher training and educational policy are discussed.",

We also note a growing trend: the success of a MOOC is not necessarily measured in terms of the number of students who complete the course, but instead the number of students who enroll in it. These steep drop-out rates have been called a \u201cfunnel of participation\u201d.",

In this paper we present tools, recently developed, that can support interrelation and synchronization of various streams of field data. A key characteristic of these tools is their support for a multi-level structure of annotations, through which the problemsolving activity can be interpreted and presented. This multi-level representation can be inter-related to the raw field data, and can drive the navigation of the researcher in the activity data. An example of use of these tools for analysis and evaluation of a collaborative problem solving activity is presented in the demo that accompanies this paper.",

Instead more contextual information is needed to be captured in heterogeneous media like video, audio files, snapshots, etc in order to re-construct the learning process. A software environment (Collaborative Analysis Tool ColAT) that supports inter-relation of such resources in order to analyse the collected evidence and produce interpretative views of the activity is described.",

No sooner had this discussion come to a closing than several curricula developed, in the framework of various initiatives for the promotion of CT in K-12 education. In the meantime, concerns that CT is neither a unique and distinctive nor an adequate characterization of CS (Denning, Commun ACM 52:28\u201330, 2009), and thus supports a limited view of the role of CS in general education, were expressed. This chapter explores the conceptual interpretation of CT in widely known K-12 curricula. Furthermore, the paper explores the understanding of CT by the teachers as this is depicted in the pedagogical translation (Deng, J Curriculum Stud 41:585\u2013604, 2009) of the curricula into learning activities.

The main argument of the paper is that mobile technology can support the play with the exhibits of a museum-instead of just viewing them in the more traditional way--and in this context the spectrum of children interaction with the exhibits can be broadened and enriched.",

This study aims to investigate preschool teachers\u2019 views about the integration of digital games in the classroom. Views from ten Greek preschool teachers were collected with semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Teachers mention that use various digital environment such as\" KidMedia\",\" RamKid\",\" Kidepedia\",\" TuxPaint\" as digital games and use them mainly for students\u2019 assessment or just for relaxation, while fewer choose to teach through digital games. Teachers observe that children are more focused and are more productive without complaining and getting bored easily. Finally, participants report as barriers mainly the lack of equipment.

            "Abstract": "An increasing amount of data is collected today during studies in which students and educators are engaged in learning activities using information technology and other tools. These data are indispensable for analysis and evaluation of learning activities, for evaluation of new tools and for students\u2019 meta-cognitive activities. The data can take various forms, including video and audio recordings, log files of computing-related activity, field notes, results of students work in electronic or other forms, activity sheets etc. The need for analysis tools, which can annotate these data, classify them, process them and facilitate their inspection, is of increased importance especially for science education, since the latter involves experimentation and use of laboratory and other equipment that necessitate thorough off-line analysis and evaluation. In this paper we discuss first the key requirements of a new generation of interaction and collaboration analysis tools. We then present how these requirements have lead to the design of a prototype tool, recently developed. This tool can relate and synchronize various streams of field data. An important characteristic of the tool is its support for a multi-layer structure of annotations of various levels of abstraction, through which the activity can be interpreted and presented. This multi-layer representation can be inter-related to the raw field data, and can drive the navigation of the researcher in the activity data. An example of use of this tool for analysis and evaluation of a collaborative problem solving activity is also included.

            "Abstract": "Children\u2019s learning in terms of programming is an objective nowadays, while environments that can effectively support the ability to understand these more profound concepts are limited. There are many and important reasons why computer programming, and particularly computational thinking (Wing, 2006), should be introduced as a subject in schools from the early ages. First of all, engaging a child with programming concepts helps him to strengthen his logical thinking. Although there are many programming languages that can be used in school, most do not have the proper features to be used by preschool and primary-school students. The difficulty concerns either the abstract structure of the programming language (eg, difficulty in learning how to compose the command semantics) or the language development environment that is unfriendly to users of this age. Research findings support that programming for kindergarten children is possible (Fessakis, Gouli, & Mavroudi, 2013; Misirli, 2015), but it should be done within a specific framework that provides easy and tangible handling and is motivational for children (Misirli, 2015). The most popular robotic constructions used as tools for the development of the algorithmic thinking of preschool and primary-school children (Table 21.1) consist mainly of closed-type software and hardware. This fact restricts their uses, which in any case are not inexhaustible, particularly in the case of young children whose capabilities to handle algorithmic concepts are limited due to their age. The main purpose of the already existing robotics platforms for preschool and primary-school children is their integration in \u2026",

Characteristics of code that appear in other Scratch code analyses include a) Dead code, b) Initialization problems, c) Extremely Fine-Grained Programming (EFGP), d) Duplicate code and e) Long scripts. Does student code reflect code that is found in large Scratch project repositories or other settings? Does student code have other characteristics? We taught two fifth-grade classes (23 students each) Scratch for 9 hours. Learning Scratch was part of a compulsory 1 hour per week ICT course. After each hour we gathered students' projects that comprised our data (code base). The analysis of the code base showed that many of the characteristics of code that were found elsewhere were also present in the classroom, namely, dead code, initialization problems and EFGP. Duplicate code and long scripts did not appear in the code base in a large percentage. We also discovered that students\u2019 projects featured race conditions and code that had no effect. Such codes provide learning opportunities. When students create these types of codes, they face a problematic situation and they will have to reflect on their code. Since Scratch makes tinkering easy by design, they may find a way to move forward, otherwise the teacher should be able to assist them.",

Beyond the designed environment and the gaming aspect, MMOGs constitute virtual spaces rich in social interactions. Players form groups and develop networks of people not only for attaining the goals of the game, but also for socially enhancing their in-game experience (Nardi & Harris, 2006). Our aim is to address the social aspect of MMOGs and discuss the formation and implications of social networks. Based on the analysis of data from virtual ethnography (participant observation, interviews) and questionnaires from our research, we identify issues and questions for further study relevant to the emergence and features of social networks in MMOGs. The main issues that emerged, in relation to the social networks in MMOGs, seem to be the following:",

A total of 1165 primary and secondary education teachers participated in the study, immediately after following a training programme on basic ICT skills. The authors\u2019 results showed that the majority of the teachers in the sample have positive attitudes towards the training programme they attended, the general role that ICT can play in education and the integration of ICT in the educational process. The authors\u2019 findings also revealed some parameters that interfere negatively, thus making many teachers cautious of or sceptical about ICT integration in educational practice. Multivariate analysis identified three groups of teachers that exhibited a consistent approach: a group of teachers having positive attitudes towards the items of the research, a second group \u2026",

The environment provides debugging features such as fast execution of commands, the ability to delete single commands and trace. Two 7-year-old children used the environment, and their activities were recorded. Children had to move a simulated robot through a maze using move and direction Logo-like commands. The children used the debugging features of the environment efficiently and solved the problems assigned to them. They followed the debugging strategies such as identification of the bug, pinpointing the problematic code segment and correcting the program. The instructor was able to help them through the process when it was needed.",

In order to classify the verbal interactions during their collaboration, Mercer's and Yelland's model was adopted as a means to understand the cognitive dimension of children's talk around computers. In addition, Inkpen's taxonomy of mouse usage across the group members' was adopted in order to deeply understand their expressed low level interaction styles.

These data are indispensable for analysis and evaluation of learning activities, for evaluation of new tools and for students\u2019 meta-cognitive activities. The data can take various forms, including video and audio recordings, log files of computing-related activity, field notes, results of students work in electronic or other forms, activity sheets etc. The need for analysis tools, which can annotate these data, classify them, process them and facilitate their inspection, is of increased importance especially for science education, since the latter involves experimentation and use of laboratory and other equipment that necessitate thorough off-line analysis and evaluation. In this paper we discuss first the key requirements of a new generation of interaction and collaboration analysis tools. We then present how these requirements have lead to the design of a prototype tool, recently developed. This tool can relate and synchronize various streams of field data. An important characteristic of the tool is its support for a multi-layer structure of annotations of various levels of abstraction, through which the activity can be interpreted and presented. This multi-layer representation can be inter-related to the raw field data, and can drive the navigation of the researcher in the activity data. An example of use of this tool for analysis and evaluation of a collaborative problem solving activity is also included.",

This article describes the MuseumScrabble mobile game, aimed at children visiting a historical museum. The game requires that the players explore the museum and link abstract concepts with physical artefacts using a mobile device. The focus of this article is on the interaction design process and the subsequent observations made during field evaluation of the game. Design principles that guide the development of such a game are presented and concern playfulness, learning, social interaction, physical aspects of the game and flow between physical and digital space. This article explores how these design principles are reflected in the study and how problem-solving strategies and collaboration and competition patterns are developed by children in this multi-player educational game.",

In this paper, we introduce a scenario-based approach for designing educational robotics activities aiming to support co-creative problem solving in K12 formal education contexts.

Concept mapping is one of the most known ways for representing knowledge visually [Novak & Gowin, 1984; McAleese, 1998] and consequently for externalizing the representations of those who learn by using graphs in a tree or network form. The Representation Tool 2 equips its users with the appropriate tools for individual and collective expression of knowledge by facilitating the process of handling the concepts and the relations that link them. The Tool provides for the rapid development and exchange of concept maps through its common working environment and access to others creations (concept maps). It also has the potential for simultaneous map development either on local network level or over the Internet that is supported by appropriate dialogue boxes and negotiation tools. The collective development of concept maps and the procedure of negotiation enables real time collaboration, where social \u0153 cognitive conflicts are more likely to emerge.",

Une tendance importante se dessine: on ne parle plus n\u00e9cessairement de r\u00e9ussite dans un MOOC et termes du nombre d\u2019apprenants ayant termin\u00e9 un cours, mais plut\u00f4t en fonction du nombre d\u2019inscrits.

            "Abstract": "In this paper, students\u2019 practices and performance were studied, while using a Learning Management System in a blended learning environment. This is a case study involving 117 students who attended an academic course based upon a blended learning approach, using an open source e-learning environment (Moodle). The course refers to ICT integration in education and has been reformulated to be offered in the context of blended learning. The course\u2019s methodology was mainly based on a problem solving approach. The impact of nine variables depicting the expressed students\u2019 practices while using Moodle was examined (spectrum of use, assignment view, forum add post, forum view, resource view user\u2019s profile inspection, questionnaire and glossary inspection) on their performance. A multiple regression was applied to investigate relation between the students\u2019 practices and their performance. From the analysis of the collected data it was depicted that the system usage is significantly related with the students\u2019 performance, explaining the 20.2% of variance in their total grades.",

Various classes of teaching and learning systems are discussed in terms of technologies used and pedagogical approaches. Their usability is analyzed according to various dimensions and the impact of system usability on the learning effectiveness is studied. We argue that various classes of ICTE applications such as multimedia/hypermedia applications, open educational environments and CSCL environments, based on different theoretical perspectives, require fundamentally different approaches in evaluating their usability. The paper is structured as follows: an overview of different usability evaluation approaches is presented first, followed by a discussion on applicability of these techniques in various categories of teaching and learning computer systems.

            "Abstract": "The present paper presents a systematic review of the last 30 years that concerns records on Smart Toys and focuses on toys regarding early childhood and primary education children (3\u201312 years old). This paper aims to analyse and categorise smart toys (50 articles) in terms of their technological and educational affordances. The results show that the toys are designed based on four main technological affordances and their combinations. The educational affordances of smart toys are studied in terms of different use modes and their learning objectives aimed to identify specific objectives in different subjects and objectives based on transversal competencies such as problem solving, spatial thinking, computational thinking, collaboration and symbolic thinking. Finally, with the multiple correspondence analysis, the correlations between smart toys\u2019 individual technological and educational affordances are grouped with the evolution of affordances related to their development date. In conclusion, in recent years, smart toys concern special sciences (programming) and some 21st-century skills (STEM and computational thinking). In contrast, in the first 20 years, the interest focused more on transverse skills, such as collaboration, emotional thinking, symbolic thinking, story-telling and problem solving.",

Software designers and developers often come across the challenge of overcoming the raising technical and organizational problems. These problems include mostly the limited bandwidth of networks especially of dialup connections, but also the presence of firewalls and proxy servers in intranets that inhibit peer-to-peer communication. A flexible architecture needs to be defined that overcomes these problems and permits a smooth collaborative environment that would satisfy the needs of end users. This paper describes a study on these problems and provides solutions accordingly by defining the architecture of a peer-to-peer collaborative system developed and used for real-time collaborative modelling activities.",

            "Abstract": "Computer-supported collaborative problem solving requires new methodological approaches of interaction and problem solving analysis. Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called \u201cObject-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)\u201d is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are \u2018owned\u2019by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF is based on both actions and dialogues of actors, providing qualitative as well as quantitative indicators of collaboration and solution quality. The paper presents first the framework notation. Examples of its use in analysis of distance groups and face-to-face collaborative activities are provided next, followed by the dimensions of the framework supported analysis for teachers and researchers. Web-based tools supporting the OCAF approach are also presented.",

It was designed to foster children\u2019s spatial awareness so as to help them construct a model of spatial concepts with reference to a mobile object around the space, the programmable toy Bee-Bot. The educational scenario encompasses instruments designed for gathering data of the pre and post children\u2019s representations about direction and orientation concepts, the teaching activities conceived to deliver these concepts by using the programmable toy and finally instruments designed for evaluation. The evaluation took place after three weeks implementation and the results indicated statistically significant difference in children\u2019s pre and post-test intervention representations and consequently construction of spatial knowledge not only to a functional context but moreover to a more symbolic one.",

A study of collaborative modeling has been conducted in the frame of an authentic educational activity in a secondary school. The students involved were provided with sets of primitive resources of varying degrees of heterogeneity to be used during synchronous computer-mediated modeling activities. Analysis of students' peer interaction and of the produced solutions revealed that, contrary to our expectations, the group with heterogeneous resources produced solutions of similar quality to those of the reference group, although they were more active, they exchanged more messages, they were involved in deeper discussions and collaborated more for building the constituent parts of the solution.",

The ModelsCreator environment provides users merely with a representation of their own conception of curriculum concepts, so it can be categorized as an open-ended environment.

Instead, more contextual information is needed to be captured in multiple media like video, audio files, and snapshots, in order to re-construct the learning process. A software environment, Collaborative Analysis Tool,(ColAT) that supports interrelation of such resources in order to analyse the collected evidence and produce interpretative views of the activity is described.",

En effet, contrairement \u00e0 d\u2019autres domaines scien tifiques qui se consacrent surtout \u00e0 la description des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, l\u2019\u00e9ducation est avant tout une science de l\u2019action.

It has been administered to a total of 240 secondary education teachers, coming from the Ioannina prefecture, in Greece. Our results show that the great majority of the teachers in the sample are positive towards acquiring basic skills on ICT, applying ICT tools in their instruction and the role that ICT could play in education. We have recorded differences in teachers\u2019 beliefs according to their attributes such as gender, specialty, teaching experience, computer experience, training on ICT, and computer ownership. Our findings have also revealed some parameters, which interfere making thus many teachers cautious or fearful about ICT integration in the educational practice. On the other hand, multivariate analysis has identified three discrete groups of teachers which have exhibited a persistent and rather consistent approach: a group having strongly positive attitudes about ICT in education, a second group of teachers which are in general positive, and a third one with negative or neutral beliefs.",

This environment has been recently used in a number of empirical studies involving collaborative problem solving. From these studies it has been found that the representational and operation tools of the ModellingSpace common activity space influence considerably interaction and communication. Also the coordination mechanism used was found that affects problem solving and collaboration. This environment is proposed here as a tool that can be effectively integrated as a service to the students of ODL courses, in addition to more traditional asynchronous collaboration tools, improving community building.",

An innovative environment that permits real-time collaborative problem solving is described. In particular we study the effect of two alternative coordination mechanisms on the problem solving activity of pairs of students engaged in concept map building. The first mechanism imposes locking of the shared activity board for one student at a time, while the second mechanism allows access of all group members to the shared activity board in a contemporary way. The reported findings are of interest to researchers and practitioners who are involved in the design and study of real-time collaborative learning environments.",

In this study, we aim to analyze ER opportunities for 21st century education, in general, and CPS skills, according to the PISA CPS framework. To achieve this, we first review the design requirements of the learning activities that have been identified in the literature as sustaining CPS. Afterwards, we identify the design requirements of ER activities that can sustain the development of CPS. Activities engaging learners in authentic ill-defined problems, with a certain level of complexity are identified as design \u2026",

As the project has come to its end, a first evaluation of the outcomes is attempted in this paper at the level of one of the participating universities. The University of Patras has been a major partner in this project. It has been the Greek institution with the higher number of open courses developed in the frame of it. So it is worth looking closely into the produced results and in particular the views and attitudes of the faculty that participated in the process. In this paper, we report on the findings of a survey that was conducted during the final phase of the project. This survey asked key faculty members that participated in the action to provide their view on the experience and make suggestions on the future of open courseware in the University.",

The focus is on the types of reasoning developed in the modeling process, as well as on the reasoning coherence around the central concept of plant growth. The findings of the study show that a significant proportion of the 18 participating dyads perform modeling on both levels, while their ability to shift between them as well as between the various elements of the \u2018micro\u2010conceptual\u2019 level is rather constrained.

By employing the methodological tool of Aviram & Tami, this research carries out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of texts published in the Greek scientific Journal \u201cContemporary Education\u201d and studies the discourse formulated about the integration of ICT in Greek Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. This analysis attempts to distinguish and \u201cmap\u201d the different approaches expressed by the articles' authors on this integration. The research results revealed a strong tendency of Greek STEM education to attach primarily didactic and administrative approaches to ICT integration leading to micro level changes. It is quite interesting that\u2013during the time period of this study-none of authors' approaches were adopted a systemic view, in the direction of extensive changes in the Greek educational system, in order to facilitate the integration of ICT in STEM education.",

There is currently a real enthusiasm for educational robotics which is supported by the incessant emergence of new educational robots and articles published by the media. Undoubtedly, at least at the level of primary education, a new wave of technology appeared in order for concepts of programming (or\" coding\") sweeps to be applied, which consequently raises the question of what it can bring to teachers and learners over time. At the same time, scientific research in this field is making significant progress in recent years by providing interesting results in both basic and applied research. On the other hand, there are many challenges with obtaining data with respect to the appropriation of this type of approach by teachers. Indeed, initial and in-service training of teachers is a major challenge to develop learning activities with educational robots which help develop specific learning objectives as well as the development of high-order thinking skills.",

Database technology has significant economic impact and the demand for database design cannot be covered by the existent educated experts. Furthermore, the database management systems available at schools could be used for the design and implementation of high quality learning activities. Databases are general purpose modeling environments that enable problem solving using conceptual frameworks closer to the solver and the problem than the machine architecture. Databases design introduction in the curricula of secondary education programs raises educational research questions. Research questions concern the didactics of the subject as well as the value of database design based learning activities. In this paper, we present some of the more significant findings of an action research concerning the database \u2026",

These interactions are directed both by the design of the environment as well as by the community of the players. There are strong indications that these environments constitute, beyond of environments for fun, environments of collaborative learning through interactions with peers. Through this paper, we review research in the area of collaborative learning and relate it to relevant findings from the area of research in MMOGs and findings from our own research, in an attempt to formulate a conceptual model for the investigation of collaborative learning processes in MMOGs.",
