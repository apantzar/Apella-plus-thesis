            "Abstract": "In systems developed without aspect-oriented programming, code implementing a crosscutting concern may be spread over many different parts of a system. Identifying such code automatically could be of great help during maintenance of the system. First of all, it allows a developer to more easily find the places in the code that must be changed when the concern changes and, thus, makes such changes less time consuming and less prone to errors. Second, it allows the code to be refactored to an aspect-oriented solution, thereby improving its modularity. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of clone detection as a technique for the identification of crosscutting concerns. To that end, we manually identify five specific crosscutting concerns in an industrial C system and analyze to what extent clone detection is capable of finding them. We consider our results as a stepping stone toward an automated \"aspect miner \u2026",

The EPICS program began at Purdue University in 1995. The idea behind EPICS is to have undergraduate students earn college credit for working on long-term, multi-semester projects to benefit charity and non-profit organizations. The projects are student-driven, under faculty supervision. There are many good reasons for having an EPICS program in an undergraduate computer science major. It is excellent for leveraging knowledge from other areas of computer science such as databases, networks, operating systems, and of course software engineering. The students are highly motivated because the project is real: there are real clients who use the software, making the software lifecycle \u2026",

Barnabas Task\u2019s mission is\u201ccommunity transformation through leadership development\u201d(Barnabas Task, 2013), and they utilize community health evangelism (CHE) to accomplish this goal. During these mission experiences, students have the opportunity to assist medical providers through patient triage, medical scribing, and medication dispensing. Students also work directly with community leaders to educate them on public health topics including nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, dental hygiene, and mosquito-borne illnesses. These community leaders can then educate others and spread the knowledge through grass roots. This philosophy of developing a relationship with host communities",

The current state of such training systems must advance to a Training as a Service (TaaS) future state in order to adapt to a volatile defense budget, conform to policy updates, and enhance the training capabilities afforded to the War fighter. TaaS will transform current Army training applications into distributed web-based services, allowing them to be accessible across any location via thin client workstations and wireless mobile devices. The motivation behind this migration is coming from the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture Guidance published by the U.S. Army Chief Information Officer and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology.

In this paper, we address the issue of how to effectively re\u2010engineer business software applications using BOs as a reuse technique. To this end, we first identify the reuse features of business objects and then compare them with other reuse techniques. In addition, we show that software re\u2010engineering can be more economical when business objects are used. Our work also provides guidance on how to develop and use a Business Object Architecture (BOA), which is shared by a group of interrelated and interdependent software applications. We argue that such architecture allows for more efficient reuse and better maintainability and it is illustrated by means of a case study in a realistic manufacturing environment.",
