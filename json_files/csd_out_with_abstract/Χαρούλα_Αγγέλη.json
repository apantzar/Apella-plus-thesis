            "Abstract": "About a decade ago, several researchers used Shulman\u2019s (1986) framework about Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)\u2013a body of knowledge that constitutes a special amalgam of content, pedagogy, learn-ers, and context\u2013as a theoretical basis for developing TPCK or TPACK: a framework for guiding teach-ers\u2019 cognition about technology integration in teaching and learning (Angeli, Valanides, & Christodoulou, 2016). Different models of TPCK/TPACK are proposed in the literature, each with a different focus (on practice, instructional design, context, etc.) and with a different theoretical interpretation about the nature and development of the knowledge that teachers need to have to be able to teach with technology (eg, Angeli & Valanides, 2005, 2009, 2013; Koehler & Mishra, 2008; Niess, 2005). The two dominant TPCK/TPACK models in the literature are the integrative model and the transformative model. The integrative model is more closely associated with the term TPACK, and was proposed by Koehler and Mishra (2008). It conceptualizes TPCK as an integrative body of knowledge that is created on the spot by the mere inter-sections between different bodies of knowledge, such as content and pedagogy, content and technology, and pedagogy and technology. The transformative model was proposed by Angeli and Valanides (2005) and, unlike the integrative model, it conceptualizes TPCK as a unique body of knowledge that needs to be ex-plicitly taught by teacher educators. In the transformative model, content, pedagogy, learners, technology, and context are regarded as significant individual contributors to the development of TPCK.",

            "Abstract": "In current literature, one is offered a number of ways of discussing critical thinking, and furthermore, authors follow different tracks grounded in a variety of disciplines (philosophical, psychological and educational) to approach the concept. The only consensus within this topic seems to be the claim that there is no consensus concerning the definition and the construct of critical thinking. I propose that the critical thinking is a complex concept, which simultaneously involves components at three levels, at the level of the culture, the individual and the language. I call the resulting framework a multilevel model (MLM) of the critical thinking concept. The paper argues that the study of critical thinking and non-critical thinking instances within the framework of the MLM allows us a better understanding of the phenomena internationally, and in addition, that no one level can be singled out as the only appropriate level of analysis of critical thinking instances.",

Succinctly, dyads of sixth-grade students were engaged in distributed collaborative inquiry regarding the scientific concepts of light, vision, and color in order to solve a mystery problem about a stolen diamond. ODRES was employed to scaffold students\u2019 collaborative inquiry with different tools, such as the simulator that simulates the effects of the color of a light source on an object, the magnifying glass that enables students to make careful observations, and the notebook that organizes the results of students\u2019 investigations. Students performed two cycles of collaborative inquiry, and each cycle was followed by a classroom discussion where students could present their solutions, share information, reflect, raise questions, and get feedback about their proposed solutions. The results showed that learning with ODRES positively affected students\u2019 understandings and promoted a lasting effect on their conceptions. Moreover, the results provide useful guidance about how ODRES can be used as a learning tool in collaborative inquiry, and explain the role of discussion and investigation of inquiry processes at the level of a distributed cognitive system. Implications for designing distributed educational systems for children are finally discussed. (Keywords: distributed cognitive system, collaborative inquiry, computer-assisted learning \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The study provides evidence concerning elementary school children's ability to conduct a scientific investigation. Two hundred and fifty sixth-grade students and 248 fourth-grade students were administered a test, and based on their performance, they were classified into high-ability and low-ability students. The sample of this study was randomly selected and included 80 students, 40 fourth-grade and 40 sixth-grade students of low and high abilities. Students were specifically instructed to investigate the functioning of a device, to think aloud prior and after any experiment with the device, and to keep a record of their experimental results. The results showed that students were inclined to mainly collect evidence from the experimental space and failed to control variables during their investigation. The majority of the students had difficulties with effectively organizing collected data and failed to coordinate hypotheses with evidence. The significant interaction effect that was found between grade level and ability in terms of students' investigation ability indicates that the existing gap between high- and low-ability students becomes bigger as students become older. Undoubtedly, ongoing research efforts for identifying patterns of children's cognitive development will be most valuable as they can have important implications for the design of teaching scenarios and inquiry-based science activities conducive to accelerating students' cognitive growth and scientific investigation abilities. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach. The authors conclude that future \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In today\u2019s modern societies, digital devices are a seamless part of everybody\u2019s life. It is, therefore, widely recognized by higher education institutions and organizations that digital skills must constitute an important component of human capital, and a goal for education. Blogs are social media tools that enable the publication of digital information. In particular, blogs are powerful instructional tools, because, they require information from multiple sources, such as, text, images, videos and links. Additionally, blogs support integrated and authentic student assessment, as they can be used as artifacts that students can create through their course of learning. In this paper, the authors examine the role of blogs as instructional tools for enhancing the digital skills of 21st century learners in university settings. Specifically, we present preliminary results from a research study that was conducted to teach undergraduate students how to effectively use the web for educational purposes. Preliminary research results indicate that undergraduate students are mostly content consumers rather that content creators. In particular, while they demonstrate strong operational and social skills when navigating the web, they lack skills related to completing more advanced tasks, such as information search and content creation. The results also show a strong need for future studies to focus on critical literacies, such as the evaluation and ethical use of digital content.",

            "Abstract": "We report on the findings of a study that was completed in July of 2002 regarding the affordances of asynchronous conferencing to foster quality computer-mediated interactions. Specifically, we investigated the extent to which COW, can be used to extend classroom discussion beyond scheduled class time. The results of the study indicated that COW did not encourage extensive communication among the participants. In addition, participants' discourse was mostly unjustified claims and personal opinions, and evidence of critical thinking was scarce. Undoubtedly, the integration of conferencing systems in classroom settings constitutes a complex issue. We conclude that any tool alone, no matter how powerful it might be, it is not a mindtool, but it can be transformed into a mindtool depending on how and when it is utilized and for what purposes.",

Technology Mapping, a method proposed in the literature for developing TPCK, was used for rethinking the instructional design of the unit\" Data-Processing-Information\", so that Excel could be adequately utilized for teaching it. In particular, the technical affordances of Excel were used in a powerful pedagogical way in order to eliminate learners' existing misconceptions about the three concepts. Twelve eighth graders, five girls and seven boys, participated in the study. Students had basic computing skills, but no prior knowledge about how to use Excel. The classroom teacher chose to use Excel, because it is a tool that enables quick data entry \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The purpose of this chapter was to examine the extent to which adopting the learning by design approach, as it was instantiated with a specific instructional systems design (ISD) model, in an information communication technology (ICT) teacher professional development programme could be an effective approach for developing science teachers' ICT-related pedagogical content knowing (ICT-related PCKg). ICT-related PCKg is conceptualized as an extension to Shulman's (1986) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and is described as the ways knowledge about tools and their affordances, pedagogy, content, learners, and context are synthesized into an understanding of how particular topics can be taught with ICT in ways that signify the added value of ICT.Ten science teachers participated in the programme. The span of the programme was 70 periods of 45-minutes over four months. A qualitative analysis of participants' ICT-enhanced lessons and information from other sources indicated that the learning by design approach constitutes an effective approach for developing teachers' ICT-related PCKg. Specifically, the majority of the teachers who participated in the study selected appropriate science topics to be taught with ICT, transformed science content with appropriate ICT tools and ICT-supported representations, identified ICT-supported teaching tactics, and integrated their ICT activities in the classroom with inquiry-based pedagogy. The development of teachers' ICT-related PCKg seems to be a challenging task, and teachers, as well as teacher-educators, need to undertake systematic committed efforts for its evolution and growth \u2026",

Accordingly, the researchers used two scaffolding techniques in the form of external memory systems, namely, Type A and Type B. The two scaffolding techniques were designed taking into consideration gender differences in terms of the types of learning activities that pre-primary education boys and girls prefer at this level of development. According to the findings, while both genders benefited from both scaffolding techniques, a statistically significant interaction effect between gender and scaffolding technique was detected showing that boys benefited more from the individualistic, kinesthetic spatially oriented, and manipulative \u2026",

Only one group was guided to use Filamentality, a fill-in-the-blank interactive Web site, and to organize Internet information in a Hotlist and a Scrapbook. Questionnaires were administered to collect data related to students\u2019 perceived task effort (PTE) as a result of integrating ICT in the learning environment, and their confidence levels in using ICT tools, while their initial attitudes toward ICT and its integration in the classroom were taken into consideration. The results indicated that Filamentality effectively scaffolded particular aspects of ICT integration in learning and instruction, and significantly reduced learners\u2019 amount of PTE, but there was not always a significant effect on learners\u2019 self-reported confidence levels.",

Nonetheless, learning how to think, communicate, and problem-solve can be taught, and greatly depends on classroom practices (Bruer, 1993). New interactive and computer-based technologies can be integrated in the classroom to scaffold and amplify students' thinking and learning (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2001). Several researchers (eg, Glass & Mackey, 1988; Haken, 1981; Jonassen & Reeves, 1996; Penner, 2000/2001) assert that dynamic systems modeling tools are perhaps the most intellectually demanding technologies that\" enhance the cognitive powers of human beings during thinking, problem solving, and learning\"(Jonassen & Reeves \u2026",

Group A learned first with the glass-box simulation followed by the black-box simulation, while Group B used the tools in the reverse order.

            "Abstract": "The present review aspires to familiarize readers with the main stakes of action research, and single out its pertinence to the vision of critical and effective education. Thus, the theoretical and conceptual arsenal of action research, its core assumptions, its rationale, and its relevance to science education are briefly explored. Action research emerges as research in education and not as research on education, and its philosophical framework includes a politicized, ideology-laden, action-oriented, and constructivist conception of reflection and knowledge. However, action research does also suffer from problems and frequently succumbs to manipulation and power relations. Nevertheless, it constitutes the most convincing contemporary approach that stands against rival rationalist or technicist views. Action research also promises to empower teachers and limit their dependence on academic researchers, and to make students\u2019 learning experiences more lasting, fulfilling, and scientifically organized. Teachers as reflective practitioners will be also continually reminded through their own activities that science is not just about human inventiveness, progress, and control over inner and outer nature, but that it is also or, perhaps, even more about limits that the well-being of the community and the environment poses to human ambition.",

            "Abstract": "Computational thinking is an essential skill for the twenty-first century. Teacher education departments, however, do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The question, then, becomes how to include the teaching of computational thinking in teacher education courses. The present study directly addresses this issue. In particular, the study proposes the use of scaffolded programming scripts as one method for teaching computational thinking in pre-service teacher education. In this study, scaffolded programming scripts were used in the context of educational robotics activities for the teaching of a science lesson on gears. The results report effects on pre-service teachers\u2019 computational thinking, knowledge about gears and how they work, and self-reported efficacy to teach with educational robotics. The authors discuss implications and future research directions.",

The results of the study showed that (a) Model-It, through its scaffolds (ie, Plan, Build, and Test modes), enabled the majority of preservice teachers to build models that were structurally correct,(b) participants' models were structurally correct but simplistic, and (c) 65% of the participants preferred to teach science using the explorative modeling method, 27% the expressive method, and only 8% both the explorative and the expressive methods. In essence, Model-It effectively scaffolded preservice teachers' first modeling experiences and enabled them to quickly build and test their models. It is, however, recognized that systematic efforts need to be undertaken in teacher education \u2026",

The study extends the theoretical framework of TPCK to a design framework and proposes a methodology and instructional design guidelines that address both the cognitive and the affective domains of learning. The research has both practical and theoretical significance as it provides teachers with explicit guidance on how to design music lessons based on TPCK principles, and, examines interactions among content, technology, cognition, and affect. Through the 4E perspective, technology and the proposed approach are viewed as agents of a distributed system that can support the embodied minds to develop musical and emotional understanding.",

The debate has often centered on two different approaches of teaching reading and writing, namely the phonics approach and the whole language approach. Chall (1967, 1989), an advocate of the phonics approach, warned us that whole language does not provide enough structure for children who come from homes that are not reading-supportive and recommended that this structure be systematically provided. On the other hand, Goodman (1986), an advocate of whole language, asserted that the phonics approach makes language learning difficult because it breaks language into arbitrary and abstract little pieces. Language, as a consequence, too often becomes unrelated to the needs and experiences of learners. Although the debate continues, and no matter which side \u2026",

            "Abstract": "The present review aspires to familiarize readers with the main stakes of action research, and single out its pertinence to the vision of critical and effective education. Thus, the theoretical and conceptual arsenal of action research, its core assumptions, its rationale, and its relevance to science education are briefly explored. Action research emerges as research in education and not as research on education, and its philosophical framework includes a politicized, ideology-laden, action-oriented, and constructivist conception of reflection and knowledge. However, action research does also suffer from problems and frequently succumbs to manipulation and power relations. Nevertheless, it constitutes the most convincing contemporary approach that stands against rival rationalist or technicist views. Action research also Promises to empower teachers and limit their dependence on academic researchers, and to make students' learning experiences more lasting, fulfilling, and scientifically organized. Teachers as reflective practitioners will be also continually reminded through their own activities that science is not just about human inventiveness, progress, and control over inner and outer nature, but that it is also or, perhaps, even more about limits that the well-being of the community and the environment poses to human ambition.

In essence, TPCK researchers worked toward enhancing or extending Shulman\u2019s PCK to address the knowledge needed to teach with technology.

            "Abstract": "Adding computer science as a separate school subject to the core K-6 curriculum is a complex issue with educational challenges. The authors herein address two of these challenges:(1) the design of the curriculum based on a generic computational thinking framework, and (2) the knowledge teachers need to teach the curriculum. The first issue is discussed within a perspective of designing an authentic computational thinking curriculum with a focus on real-world problems. The second issue is addressed within the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge explicating in detail the body of knowledge that teachers need to have to be able to teach computational thinking in a K-6 environment. An example of how these ideas can be applied in practice is also given. While it is recognized there is a lack of adequate empirical evidence in terms of the effectiveness of the frameworks proposed herein, it is \u2026",

ICT is considered an important catalyst and tool for inducing educational reforms and progressively extending and modifying the concept of literacy. With the extensive use of ICT in schools and everyday life, the term computer literate has already been established. Schools are open systems that interact with their environment, and the effective use and integration of technology is directly associated with the role of various socio-technical factors that may impact the integration of ICT in schools. In this chapter, we report on an exploratory study undertaken in Cyprus schools to examine the status of using ICT from the perspective of socio-technical systems. Specifically, teachers\u2019 knowledge of ICT, frequency of using ICT for personal purposes, frequency of using ICT for instructional purposes in different subject matters \u2026",

            "Abstract": "[EN] Internet technologies have infiltrated higher education institutions around the world. At the same time, the latest generation of students, the so-called Generation Z (Gen Z), are entering higher education. Gen Z is the first generation born in an Internet-connected world, and digital devices are a seamless part of its life. As a result, Gen Z students have already been engaged with informal digital learning via internet-based technologies outside of formalized education settings. However, previous research has shown that their engagement with these technologies is limited and might not sufficiently cover the knowledge and skills needed to perform internet activities effectively in higher education. Additionally, their familiarity with digital devices and tools varies. Consequently, there is a need for higher education institutions to close the skills gap by applying assessment processes that will assist them in forming policies and training resources for undergraduate students. To achieve the above, research efforts need to focus on developing theoretically informed and valid instruments that measure internet skills. This study has contributed to the validation of a self-assessment questionnaire, the Internet Skills Scale, that can be used in university settings. The questionnaire measures five types of internet skills: operational, information-navigation, social, creative, and critical. The results presented herein provide directions for future research in the field.",

The following key challenges previously identified (see task force/EDUSummIT report\u2013Appendix 1) were all considered by delegates to apply in their own countries but with varying importance at different stages in their processes of curriculum change. Key Challenges (see Task Force TC 3/EDUSummIT Report Appendix 1 of this report) 1. Lack of clear understanding of Computer science/Informatics as an academic discipline. 2. Need for Computer Science/Informatics as a distinct subject in school curricula is controversial and poorly understood.3. Computational thinking, a core component of Computer Science/Informatics this considered to be important in 21st century skills, but due to its complexity, it is difficult to implement in schools. 4. The development of Computer Science/Informatics school curricula is impeded by insufficient empirical evidence of student learning in order to support content definition and sequencing. 5. Previous ICT curricula deliveries poorly prepared students for Computer Science/Informatics in further/higher education or professional employment. 6. Integrating Computer Science/Informatics across other subjects in school curricula has been ineffective.",

A clarified view of TPCK is discussed and two models for teaching and assessing TPCK are described. Technology Mapping is proposed as a design-based approach for understanding and promoting a constructivist methodology toward the development of TPCK, and an integrating model of assessment, consisting of three forms, namely, expert/teacher assessment, peer assessment, and self-assessment, is proposed for assessing TPCK.",

The results of the study showed that teachers used more cognitive statements to support their point of view when they thought alone and more cultural and emotional statements when they thought with others in dyads. Thus, based on the results, controversial ill-defi ned problem solving within a social context may trigger more emotional activity for an individual than when he or she thinks alone.

At the beginning of the semester, students were given a short questionnaire to indicate how frequently they used the technologies of the Internet and Hyperstudio. Students were also administered a 15-item questionnaire measuring their attitudes towards ICT and its integration in the classroom. The cognitive load imposed by technology was measured with a questionnaire, at the end of the semester, in terms of:(a) the mental effort they exerted to learn Hyperstudio,(b) the mental effort they exerted to search the Internet and collect quality information for their projects, and (c) the mental effort they exerted to design instructional activities using Hyperstudio. One group was deliberately instructed and guided to use Filamentality, and organize the information collected in a Hotlist and a Scrapbook, while the other was not.

Two examples of use of data mining techniques, namely, association rules mining and fuzzy representations are presented, from a study conducted in Europe and another in Australia. Both of these studies examine student learning, behaviors, and experiences within computer-supported classroom activities. In the first study, the technique of association rules mining was used to understand better how learners with different cognitive types interacted with a simulation to solve a problem. Association rules mining was found to be a useful method for obtaining reliable data about learners' use of the simulation and their performance with it. The study illustrates how data mining can be used to advance educational software evaluation practices in the field of educational technology. In \u2026",

Succinctly, dyads of sixth-grade students were engaged in distributed collaborative inquiry regarding the scientific concepts of light, vision, and color in order to solve a mystery problem about a stolen diamond. ODRES was employed to scaffold students\u2019 collaborative inquiry with different tools, such as the simulator that simulates the effects of the color of a light source on an object, the magnifying glass that enables students to make careful observations, and the notebook that organizes the results of students\u2019 investigations. Students performed two cycles of collaborative inquiry, and each cycle was followed by a classroom discussion where students could present their solutions, share information, reflect, raise questions, and get feedback about their proposed solutions. The results showed that learning with ODRES positively affected students\u2019 understandings and promoted a lasting effect on their conceptions. Moreover, the results provide useful guidance about how ODRES can be used as a learning tool in collaborative inquiry, and explain the role of discussion and investigation of inquiry processes at the level of a distributed cognitive system.

These preservice teachers conversed electronically with peers, mentors, and instructors on the Web about cases related to their early field experiences using an asynchronous conferencing tool called Conferencing on the Web (COW). Whereas earlier research compared levels of scaffolding on student generation and discussion of cases in COW within specific time periods, this particular study allowed longer amounts of time for students to post and discuss cases. In addition, there was more qualitative data collected here than in the previous study. The 157 student participants in this study produced 319 cases during the conference with 620 peer replies and 298 mentor replies. Students submitted the majority of their cases to the secondary-school conference, while less than ten percent of the cases were submitted to the general-case conference. In effect, they failed to perceive the generalizability of their field experiences. Students received on average about three peer or mentor comments on their cases. Transcript analyses from 75 randomly selected cases indicated that students failed to justify most of their comments. In addition, peer feedback was extremely conversational and opinionated. Conversely, instructor mentoring was focused on high level questioning, providing examples, and case specific feedback. While data from student interviews and evaluative surveys on their electronic conferencing experience were mixed, students who experienced this activity as part of an entire Web-based \u2026",

The results of the study showed that (a) Model-It, through its scaffolds (i.e., plan, build, and test modes), enabled the majority of preservice teachers to build models that were structurally correct, (b) participants' models were structurally correct but simplistic, and (c) 65% of the participants preferred to teach science using the explorative modeling method, 27% the expressive method, and only 8% both the explorative and the expressive methods. In essence, the software provided participants with a tool to quickly build and test their models as well as reflect on the viability of their models. Thus, Model-it effectively scaffolded preservice teachers' first modeling experiences. It is however recognized that systematic efforts need to be undertaken to adequately prepare prospective teachers to teach science through models.",

Educating teachers on how to effectively integrate technology in classroom practices has been one of the main and continual goals of national and international school reform efforts in various countries (NCEE, 2007; Mouza, 2009). A variety of approaches have been adopted over the years to prepare and support teachers in integrating technology in classroom practices, although the results have not always been positive (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2010). For this reason, about a decade ago, researchers around the world set out to develop a conceptual framework to systematically guide teachers\u2019 cognition about technology integration. Overwhelmingly, researchers agreed that teachers need to develop a body of knowledge that has been referred to in the literature as Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge.",

This paper looks at its role in three countries to illustrate these differences. A reconsideration of computer science as a separate subject both in primary and secondary education is suggested. At EDUsummIT 2015 it was argued that the major rationales for including computer science as a subject in the K-12 curriculum are economic, social and cultural. The paper explores these three rationales and also a beneficence matrix to assist curriculum designers. It also argues computer science is rapidly becoming critical for generating new knowledge, and should be taught as a distinct subject or content area, especially in secondary schools. The paper concludes by looking at some of the key questions to be considered when implementing computer science in the school \u2026",

They were then instructed to resolve their conflicting ideas through electronic discussion. Students had two weeks time to participate in the online discussion by posting their points of view as well as replying to others' postings using the asynchronous discussion feature of WebCT. Students discussed these claims, and conducted more experiments, whenever they felt they need, in order to reach consensus about their opposing claims. The online discussion was anonymous in order to encourage students' participation in dialogue and negotiation of meaning. It was thus possible to identify students' alternative frameworks and attempt to facilitate conceptual change and understanding. The instructor of the course participated in the online discussion as a student by asking challenging questions. Students were supposed after participating in the online discussion to reach consensus and individually email their answers to the instructor. The data analysis provided ample evidence of students' patterns of thinking and their difficulties to be involved in evidence-based argumentation and reach valid conclusions acting as\" practicing scientists\" by forming and testing relevant hypotheses.(Contains 3 tables.)",

TPCK constitutes an enrichment to Shulman\u2019s (1986, 1987) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and is conceptualized as a body of knowledge that results from the interaction among different teacher knowledge bases, such as, knowledge about subject matter, pedagogy, learners, context, and technology. Studies on TPCK or TPACK\u2014a term proposed in 2007 that could be more easily spoken and remembered than TPCK\u2014are worthy of \u2026",

One hundred and eight undergraduates were randomly assigned to three different 65-min instructional interventions, namely, General, Infusion, and Immersion approaches. Statistical analyses of the data using a Repeated Measures ANOVA showed a statistically significant higher post-assessment performance, F (1, 105) = 19.769, p = .00. The main effect related to the intervention was also significant, F (2, 105) = 3.995, p = .021, but there was no significant interaction between intervention and epistemological beliefs.

One area that can benefit greatly from adaptive e-learning systems is teacher development in the educational uses of computers. In this chapter, we discuss the design of PAUL, an adaptive computer-based learning environment for the development of ICT-related pedagogical content knowledge, a unique body of knowledge that teachers need to develop in order to be able to teach with ICT. PAUL combines two opposing trends in adapting instruction, namely instruction that is both controlled by the learner and the system. We expect the impact of PAUL to be significant as it will provide a venue for effective teacher professional development situating learning in virtual communities of practice and supporting teacher thinking about the educational uses of ICT in teaching and \u2026",

Succinctly, dyads of sixth-grade students were engaged in distributed collaborative inquiry regarding the scientific concepts of light and color in order to solve a mystery problem about a stolen diamond. ODRES\u2122 was employed to scaffold students\u2019 collaborative inquiry with different tools, such as the simulator that simulates the effects of the color of a light source on an object, the magnifying glass that enables students to make careful observations, and the notebook that organizes the results of students\u2019 investigations. The results showed that learning with ODRES\u2122 positively affected students\u2019 understandings and promoted a lasting effect on their conceptions. Moreover, the results provide useful guidance about how ODRES\u2122 can be used as a learning tool in collaborative inquiry and explain the role of discussion and investigation of inquiry processes at the level of a distributed cognitive system.

Nonetheless, the factors related to the development of computational thinking are under investigation (Rom\u00e1n-Gonz\u00e1lez, P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Moreno-Le\u00f3n, & Robles, 2018). Consequently, the study herein investigated the impact of scaffolding and gender in the development of one hundred and eighty children\u2019s computational thinking. The results indicated strong interaction (p< 0.000) between the aforementioned factors and the advancement of computational thinking producing practical suggestions for the preschool educators and the computing community in general.",

            "Abstract": "Computational thinking is an essential skill for people to develop so that they can manage challenges in their personal and professional lives. Accordingly, during the last decade, lots of efforts have been undertaken to teach computational thinking in educational settings starting as early as pre-primary education. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. In this article, the author concurs with existing research showing that teacher education departments do not currently know how to promote computational thinking in their programs. The question, then, becomes how to include the teaching of computational thinking in teacher education courses. The present study directly addresses this issue. In particular, the study proposes the use of scaffolded programming activities with robots in an educational technology course \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Fifty-six third-year kindergarten student teachers (KTS) were presented with an experimental setting for investigating shadow phenomena. Prior to performing any specific experiment, KTS were asked to externalize their ideas about shadow phenomena corresponding to different configurations of the experimental setting through the use of drawings accompanied by textual explanations. Then, they were asked to perform each of the corresponding experiments and compare the experimental outcomes with their own initial conceptions. The findings clearly demonstrated that the use of drawings and textual explanations triggered students\u2019 thinking as they progressively restructured their internal representations. Implications for using visuals in science education are also discussed.",

Distancing ourselves from the older rationalist framework, we explain that what we think wrong with the skills perspective is, amongst other things, its absolutization of performativity and outcomes. In reviewing the relevant discourse, we accept that it is possible for the skills paradigm to be change\u2010friendly and context\u2010sensitive but we argue that it is oblivious to other, non\u2010purposive kinds of rationality that are indispensable to critical thought. Our suggestion is that there is an aporetic element in critical thought that is missing from contemporary educational positions. We consider some other efforts to redeem the surplus of criticality that performativity fails to take into account and conclude that the aporetic element that we highlight accommodates better than other \u2026",

A counterbalanced measures design was adopted to investigate the extent to which there was an interaction effect between field dependence-independence (FD-I) and order of learning with a glass-box simulation and a black-box simulation. According to the results, there was a statistically significant interaction between FD-I and the order of using the glass-box and the black-box simulations. Specifically, the findings showed that learning first with the black-box simulation facilitated field-dependent children's subsequent learning with the glass-box simulation enabling them to perform as good as field-independent children.",

The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) framework and developments in associated research are reviewed. The authors suggest an alternate approach for better understanding the knowledge base required for application of ICT in education by providing a theorization about technological knowledge in relation to how a teacher realizes and actualizes the pedagogical affordances of technological tools in teaching and learning. The authors conclude that this body of knowledge cannot exist outside the frame of reference of the teacher, can be developed through systematic learning activities targeting or facilitating its development, and grows with ongoing participation or involvement in valuable professional experiences. Implications for the nature of TPCK and its development are discussed.",

Students' replies to the question posted in the online discussion forum were carefully read and analyzed. The frequency of sound (evidence-based) arguments was low. The presence of specific persistent alternative conceptions and lack of familiarity with the process of hypothesis testing or lack of the ability to clearly differentiate among hypotheses, predictions, results and conclusions seem to be the main obstacles for sound argumentation.",
