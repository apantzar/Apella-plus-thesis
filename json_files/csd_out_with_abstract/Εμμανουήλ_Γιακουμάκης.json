            "Abstract": "A possibility of pulling a front by a moving inhomogeneity is considered in the context of the Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation, which is a generic model of nonequilibrium phase-separation processes. The critical (maximum) velocity of the inhomogeneity, at which it is still able to steadily drag the front, is found in an analytical approximation, using both perturbation theory and a quasiparticle description of the front. A case of steep inhomogeneities is studied in detail by means of direct simulations, showing that the analytical prediction for the critical velocity is in very good agreement with numerical results for small and moderate values of the inhomogeneity's strength. If the driving velocity exceeds the critical value, the kink is eventually destroyed. If the perturbation is strong, the simulations show that the actual critical velocity is larger than a formally extended analytical value, i.e., the kink turns out to be more robust than it is \u2026",

Ambiguity related to the evolution of the damages from climate change is introduced into a coupled economy-climate model with explicit spatial structure due to heat transport across the globe. We seek to answer questions about how spatial robust regulation regarding climate policies can be formulated; what the potential links of this regulation to the weak and strong version of the precautionary principle (PP) are; and how insights about whether it is costly to follow a PP can be obtained. We also study the emergence of hot spots, which are locations where local deep uncertainty may cause robust regulation to break down for the whole spatial domain.",

The joint regret function is a convex combination of entropy-like or norm-dependent functionals. The relevant optimization problem is posed in terms of a partially finite convex programming problem in the space of pricing kernels.",

The situation is more difficult when it comes to privacy. For instance, when somebody\u2019s telephone number is disclosed, then it is rather subjective whether one should care or not. When a bank uses the credit history of a client without her consent in order to issue a presigned credit card, then it is subjective whether the client will feel upset about it and press charges for breach of the Personal Data Act or not.

Such type of learning approaches are highly appreciated in many fields where the observational/experimental error is significant (e.g. astronomy, biology, remote sensing, etc.) or the data nature is more complex and the traditional learning algorithms are not applicable or effective to treat them (e.g. network data, interval data, high frequency records, matrix data, etc.). Under this perspective, each observation is identified by an appropriate probability measure and the proposed statistical learning schemes rely on discrimination criteria that utilize the geometric structure of the space of probability measures through core techniques from the optimal transport theory. The discussed approaches are implemented in two real world applications: (a) clustering eurozone countries according to their observed government bond yield curves and (b) classifying the areas of a satellite image to certain land uses categories which is a standard task in remote sensing. In both case studies the results are particularly interesting and meaningful while the accuracy obtained is high.",

Through the Wiener chaos expansion the stochastic PDE is reduced to an infinite hierarchy of deterministic PDEs which is then truncated to a finite system of PDEs, that can be addressed by standard techniques. A priori and a posteriori convergence results for the method are provided. The proposed method is applied to solve the stochastic wave equation with additive noise and the stochastic Klein\u2013Gordon wave equation with multiplicative noise and the results are compared to those derived by the Monte Carlo method. The main advantages of the proposed scheme is that it provides almost identical results and is significantly faster than the Monte Carlo simulation method, providing a convenient way to compute numerically the statistical moments \u2026",

We model overconsumption by considering individuals that care about social status apart from the intrinsic utility, derived from direct consumption. We assume that there also exist individuals that care only about their own private consumption and we examine the evolution of preferences through time by allowing individuals to alter their behavior as a result of a learning process, akin to a replicator dynamics type. We consider the regulator's choice of consumption taxation and informative advertisement both in an arbitrary and an optimal control context. In the arbitrary overconsumption control context we find that the regulator could decrease, or even eliminate, the share of status seekers in the population. In the context of optimal overconsumption control, we show that the highest welfare is attained when status seekers are completely eliminated, while the lowest in the case that the entire population consists of status seekers.",

Therefore, privacy issues are becoming increasingly important. In this paper we model the risk that an IT firm is exposed to, as a result of potential privacy violation incidents. The proposed model is based on random utility modeling and aims at capturing the subjective nature of the question: \u201dhow important is a privacy violation incident to someone?\u201d. Furthermore, we propose a collective risk model for the economic exposure of the firm due to privacy violation. These models are useful for the design and valuation of optimal privacy related insurance contracts for the firm and are supportive to its risk management process.",

            "Abstract": "The operation of buildings is linked to approximately 36% of the global energy consumption, 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. Assessing the energy consumption and efficiency of buildings is a complex task addressed by a variety of methods. Building energy modeling is among the dominant methodologies in evaluating the energy efficiency of buildings commonly applied for evaluating design and renovation energy efficiency measures. Although building energy modeling is a valuable tool, it is rarely the case that simulation results are assessed against the building\u2019s actual energy performance. In this context, the simulation results of the HVAC energy consumption in the case of a smart industrial near-zero energy building are used to explore areas of uncertainty and deviation of the building energy model against measured data. Initial model results are improved based on a trial and error approach to minimize deviation based on key identified parameters. In addition, a novel approach based on functional shape modeling and Kalman filtering is developed and applied to further minimize systematic discrepancies. Results indicate a significant initial performance gap between the initial model and the actual energy consumption. The efficiency and the effectiveness of the developed integrated model is highlighted.",

In certain limiting cases the method gives important insight into the physical processes that cause the break-up of closed and heteroclinic streamlines. The approach sheds light on the important issue of transport in three-dimensional Navier\u2013Stokes flows. Specifically we show that the criterion for the existence of closed streamlines is that the line integral of the viscous force, induced from the perturbation of the flow along the unperturbed closed streamline, must vanish. We apply the approach to wavy Taylor vortex flow and show that the space averaged Melnikov function is related to the effective axial diffusivity.",

In this chapter, we present some of the most common fixed-point theorems starting from Banach\u2019s contraction mapping principle which guarantees existence of fixed points for strict contractions and then gradually start removing hypotheses on the map, working our way toward more general fixed-point theorems.

In this paper we study dynamic optimization for the joint management of resources and pollution when pollution affects resource growth and when spatial transport phe& nomena both for the resources and the pollution are present. We present approaches that deal with dynamic optimization in infinite dimensional spaces which can be used as tools in environmental and resource economic. We also present methods which can be used to study the emergence of spatial patterns in dynamic optimizations models. Our methods draw on the celebrated Turing diffusion induced instability but are different from Turingks mechanism since they apply to forward& optimization models.

To keep within the context of electromagnetic media, nonlinearity appears in a number of cases in which the dispersion relations or equivalently the coefficients of the constitutive relations change as a function of the field amplitudes. This behaviour is very common in dielectrics, where it has been experimentally verified, theoretically studied, and widely studied mathematically. Furthermore, the interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity in dielectrics has led to the observation of solitary waves, which has important applications to optical communications. Regarding chiral media, although third-order nonlinear effects were predicted as early as 1967, nonlinear optical rotation experiments were not undertaken before 1993.

First, the celebrated Cole\u2013Hopf transformation reduces the forward RBE to a forward random heat equation (RHE) that can be treated pathwise. Next we provide a connection between the backward Burgers equation and a system of FBSDEs. Exploiting this connection, we derive a generalization of the Cole\u2013Hopf transformation which links the backward RBE with the backward RHE and investigate the range of its applicability. Stochastic Feynman\u2013Kac representations for the solutions are provided. Explicit solutions are constructed and applications in stochastic control and mathematical finance are discussed.",

In meteorology and, particularly, in wind speed prediction, the spatial location of the prediction does not coincide with the spatial locations where numerical models provide estimates of the relevant quantity (which are typically grid points used for the numerical resolution of the wind transport equations). Hence, the important problem of constructing a predictive model for the wind speed at the required location using a combination of actual measurements and model predictions arises. This problem is far from trivial on account of the fact that measurements and predictions do not refer to the same quantity for the \u2026",

Three different but complementary approaches are discussed. The first approach is based on determinacy and indeterminacy arguments; it shows the ineffectiveness of the common interest rate policy rule unless properly designed. In the second approach, we revisit the problem under the light of an infinite horizon optimal control scheme, designed so as to minimize the expected deviation of the economies of the member countries from a predescribed target. The optimal solution depends, not only on the characteristics of the member economies, but also on their whole histories. In the third approach, we abandon the assumption of an infinite horizon, and we ask the question of whether a single interest rate policy rule, may synchronize the states of the member countries of the union, in a preset time horizon. The behaviour of this solution is in line with the findings of the previous approaches, in that it shows that the optimal interest rate policy rule has to depend both on the characteristics of the member countries as well as on their histories within the preset time horizon, and not exclusively on their present states.",

Such problems arise very often in decision making where the issue of modeling of the random factors introducing uncertainty arises. In this work we propose an aggregation scheme that allows a decision maker to combine various information sources or expert opinions concerning a random experiment into an\" average\" opinion which provides the best available single model for the situation at hand. The proposed method is based on variational arguments and proposes the best model as the minimizer of a properly selected weighted loss functional in the space of probability measures. Two proposals are investigated for the choice of this loss functional,(i) a weighted entropy functional including contributions from all information sources, and (ii) a weighted Wasserstein distance functional, leading to a barycentric model in the space of probability measures. Moreover, a machine learning type procedure for model selection, based in the proposed approach is developed, where the weights are chosen either by the proposed heuristic method where the weights are updated according to the information sources (experts) validity (credibility based on performance) or by standard optimization techniques. Finally, the proposed models are compared and evaluated through some simulated experiments.",

A hybrid scheme combining filter and wrapper-based approaches is proposed to develop an accurate credit scoring model with a high predictive performance. Initially, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm is applied to find an optimal set of features that is mutually and maximally dissimilar and can represent the response variable effectively, allowing for an ordering of features by their importance. Subsequently, an iterative procedure, where supervised machine learning algorithms such as the logistic regression and the linear-discriminant analysis are combined with an evolutionary optimization algorithm like the genetic algorithm, is applied to choose the feature subset that maximizes an appropriate classification measure according to the \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we study a robust-entropic optimal control problem in the presence of inside information. To be more precise, we consider an economic agent who is allowed to invest her wealth in a classical Black-Scholes type financial market. From the beginning of the trading interval, the agent exclusively possesses some inside information concerning the future realization of the stock price process. However, we assume that she is uncertain as to the validity of this information, thus introducing in this way robust aspects to our model. The aim of the economic agent is to solve an expected utility maximization problem under the worst-case scenario, taking into account her enlarged information set. By formulating this problem as a two-player, zero sum stochastic differential game, we are able to provide closed form solutions for the optimal robust strategies and the robust value function, in the case of the exponential and the power utility functions.1. Introduction. Stochastic optimal control theory is an indispensable part of mathematical economics and modern financial management. However, despite its importance and wide range of applicability, it suffers for a serious limitation since it does not incorporate model uncertainty aspects, which has been acknowledged by the Nobel laureates Hansen and Sargent [13] and many other authors (see eg Anderson et. al [2], Cairns [7], Cont [8] and references therein) as a key factor to realistic modeling.",

Market incompleteness allows for an infinity of non-arbitrage prices at which the contract can be traded. Furthermore, indivisibility of the contract does not allow for equilibrium pricing. Assuming that the agents are utility maximizers who resort to indifference pricing, we suggest and explore a plausible scenario that allows for a natural interpretation of the agreed transaction price of the contract as the outcome of a sharing rule that takes into account the relative bargaining power of the two agents, expressed as a convex optimization problem. This leads to uniquely defined transaction prices, depending on the choice of parameters such as the bargaining power of the agents.

A business model that could ease the problem is the development or/and provision of the service by an external contractor on behalf of the service provider; known as Information Technology Outsourcing. However, outsourcing a service may have the side effect of transferring personal or/and sensitive data from the outsourcing company to the external contractor.

We generalize some results that have been derived under the assumption of Brownian motion, for different types of options, and we show how they can be used for efficient and with low transactions costs asset liability management. We construct a buy and hold portfolio of stocks, bonds and options at the beginning of the investment horizon that will come as close as possible to the optimal dynamic investment policy of only stocks and bonds. Closest is defined in three distinct ways: expected utility, mean-squared error of terminal wealth and utility weighted mean-squared error of terminal wealth. Examples of asset liability management using the above buy and hold portfolio are given for the case of pension funding. In case that the time horizon considered is larger than the option expiry time we consider rolling over of the positions to the next period. We show that portfolios with options have almost the same performance with portfolios without options but at the same time reduce the VaR and CVaR significantly. Furthermore we show how a pension fund can construct an optimal portfolio based on the minimization of risk measures, such as the value at risk and the conditional value at risk.",

We find that Dz is proportional to the product of two measures of symmetry deviation. The first is a measure of the average deviation of the flow from rotational symmetry, and the second is a measure of the average deviation from flexion-free flow (a flow where the curl of the vorticity is zero). Because these quantities are obtained directly from the velocity field, we call them Eulerian symmetry measures. Thus, we show that the macroscopic transport behavior in a flow can be quantified directly in terms of the velocity field and its gradients, and hence provides a connection between Eulerian and Lagrangian pictures of transport\u2014a problem of fundamental and widespread interest.",

These relations are considered as formal expressions of the physical laws that govern the electromagnetics of complex media. When they are introduced into the Maxwell equations, we obtain differential equations (PDEs) that govern the evolution of the electromagnetic fields; the treatment of these equations, in the rigorous mathematical sense, is the main object of this monograph.

The personal valuations are formed using subjective beliefs concerning the future states of the world, and the reservation prices are calculated using expected utility theory. The agents are not rigid concerning their subjective probabilities and are willing to update them under the pressure to reach finally an agreement concerning the asset. The proposed projected dynamical system, on the space of probability measures, provides a model for the evolution of the agents, beliefs during the bargaining period and is constructed so that an agreement is reached under the minimum possible deviation of both agents from their initial beliefs. The convergence results are shown using techniques from convex dynamics and Lyapunov \u2026",

One of the common protocols used in order to achieved consensus is to make use of a neutral agent, called the facilitator whose role is to assist the procedure by allowing communication equally among different parts and initiate the procedure by a proposal which is more likely to be accepted by all decision makers. A model of this procedure is presented, providing a good candidate for the initial proposal of the facilitator and quantifying various concepts such as the bargaining power of each party.",

We suggest two different pricing approaches based on the Black-Scholes model (Black and Scholes (1973)). The results of the paper shed light on the effect of uncertainty and choice of volatility probability distribution on European option prices. We examine the cases of financial and real option. For financial options we demonstrate that even under the assumption of constant volatility and investor homogeneity, as well as without the need to resort to more complex assumptions for the underlying's stochastic process, a smile effect is justified. For the more complex case of real options we demonstrate that by neglecting parameter uncertainty we can easily missprice options by 15-20%, and that misspricing is almost a linear function in time-to-maturity and the degree to which the option is in-the-money.",

The insurer faces a claims process that is modeled by a Brownian motion with drift and has the possibility to reduce the risk involved with this process by purchasing proportional reinsurance coverage. Moreover, the insurer has some extra information at her disposal concerning the future realizations of her claims process, available from the beginning of the trading interval and hidden from the reinsurer, thus introducing in this way inside information aspects to our model. The optimal investment and proportional reinsurance decision for both firms is determined by the solution of suitable expected utility maximization problems \u2026",

We then move to a detailed study of the Fenchel\u2013Legendre conjugate and the biconjugate for convex functions and their properties. With these tools at hand, we proceed to the main aim of this chapter, the study of duality methods in optimization, which allows us to redress constrained minimization problems in saddle point form and connect with each such problem a related maximization problem called its dual (that in many cases is easier to treat than the original problem, called the primal).

We extend Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle to account for transition dynamics governed by a nonlinear partial differential equation emerging for spatial capital flows. The potential spatial heterogeneity of optimal growth as seen from the point of view of an optimizing social planner is examined. Our results suggest that for high utility discount rate the spatial capital flows induce the emergence of optimal spatial patterns while hor low utility discount a flat-earth steady state is socially optimal. Furthermore, when spatial heterogeneities exist due to total factor productivity differences across locations, we identify conditions under which the spatial capital flows could intensify or weaken spatial inequalities.",

The calculus of variations studies problems related to the minimization of integral functionals, defined in appropriate function spaces. It is a field which has been associated historically with many important applications in the physical sciences. Philosophical aspects aside, the calculusof variationsis very useful, as important partial differential equations (PDEs) can be expressed as the first-order minimization conditions for suitable integral functionals. We may then infer qualitative or quantitative information on the behavior of the solutions of these equations from the theory of minimization of the corresponding functional. On the other hand, many important models ranging from economics or decision science to engineering, signal and image processing, etc., can beexpressedintermsofintegralfunctionals (see, eg,[37] or [42 \u2026",

For the reader\u2019s convenience we start with a section (Section 6.2) containing various important concepts of scattering theory; for simplicity, the presentation is done for the relatively simple case of the scalar Helmholtz equation, whose vector analogue is strongly related to the Maxwell equations. In the following sections we present a variety of topics. In particular, Section 6.3 deals with the establishment of the reciprocity principle, the general scattering theorem and the optical theorem for the chiral obstacle in an achiral environment problem; moreover, a study of the spectrum of the far-field operator and its relation to that of the T-matrix is included. Next, in Section 6.3. 2 we consider the chiral obstacle in an achiral environment scattering \u2026",

The fund manager of the firm collects the entry fees to a portfolio savings account and this wealth is to be invested optimally in a Black\u2013Scholes type financial market. As such schemes usually last for many years, we extend our framework, by: (i) augmenting the financial market with an inflation-adjusted bond, and, (ii) taking into account mortality of the fund members. Model uncertainty aspects are introduced as the fund manager does not fully trust the model he/she faces.

Such problems lead to variational inequalities with fast-varying coefficients which require techniques related to homogenisation theory.

We employ the concept of Fr\u00e9chet mean in order to define a new class of convex risk measures, the Fr\u00e9chet risk measures, which are appropriate for this framework, and provide closed form expressions for them which clarify the interaction between risk and uncertainty. We also investigate the robustness of these measures after applying them in some standard applications, such as (a) the total claim amount estimation and (b) the selection of the static hedging strategy for contingent claims, both of these applications considered under the concept of uncertainty. The proposed risk measures are shown to be very effective in aggregating models in the set of priors, thus filtering out the effects of uncertainty and leading to robust decision making.",

Moreover, an important operator, the projection operator on convex and closed subsets of Hilbert spaces is introduced and studied in detail. Finally, we consider various notions of the geometry of Banach spaces related to convexity, introducing the concept of strictly, locally and uniformly convex Banach space and study the properties of the duality map between such spaces and their duals.

            "Abstract": "The present paper aims to study a robust-entropic optimal control problem arising in the management of financial institutions. More precisely, we consider an economic agent who manages the portfolio of a financial firm. The manager has the possibility to invest part of the firm\u2019s wealth in a classical Black-Scholes type financial market, and also, as the firm is exposed to a stochastic cash flow of liabilities, to proportionally transfer part of its liabilities to a third party as a means of reducing risk. However, model uncertainty aspects are introduced as the manager does not fully trust the model she faces, hence she decides to make her decision robust. By employing robust control and dynamic programming techniques, we provide closed form solutions for the cases of the (i) logarithmic;(ii) exponential and (iii) power utility functions. Moreover, we provide a detailed study of the limiting behavior, of the associated stochastic differential game at hand, which, in a special case, leads to break down of the solution of the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation. Finally, we present a detailed numerical study that elucidates the effect of robustness on the optimal decisions of both players.1. Introduction. The use of stochastic optimal control techniques on financial related problems was originated, to the best of our knowledge, by Merton [28], who studied a continuous time investment/consumption problem in a model consisting of two assets: a riskless asset (bond or bank account) and a risky one (stock), whose dynamics are described by the classical Black-Scoles model. For the special case",

Under standard Lipschitz and monotonicity conditions, and by means of the contraction mapping principle, we establish existence, uniqueness, a comparison property and dependence on a parameter of adapted solutions. Making further the connection with infinite horizon quasilinear backward stochastic partial differential equations (BSPDEs) via a generalization of the well known four-step-scheme, we are led to the notion of stationary stochastic viscosity solutions. A stochastic maximum principle for the optimal control problem of such FBSDEs is also provided as an application to this framework.",

Since our basic interest is the development of a mathematically rigorous framework for the study of this problem, our approach is to model random effects through the introduction of a general class of random fields1 into the system of equations that governs the evolution of the electromagnetic fields. We do not take up the question of self-consistent mathematical modelling of the random effects, starting from the starting point of first principles physical theory. Such a task, although extremely interesting and important, is well beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we assume that the randomness follows some rather general and reasonable qualitative assumptions, eg, Gaussian behaviour, etc., and use a well-founded mathematical model for it, in terms of the Wiener process \u2026",

In this effort, there are various possible solutions, one of which is provided by pension fund schemes. Essentially, a pension fund scheme constitutes an independent legal entity that represents accumulated wealth stemming from pooled contributions of its members. The aim of the proposed research is to study the problem of optimal management of defined contribution (DC) pension fund schemes within general, complex and (as much as possible) realistic frameworks. From both a theoretical and practical point of view, one of the most important issue regarding fund management is the construction of optimal investment portfolio, because the success of a DC plan crucially depends \u2026",

In particular, we focus on the \u2018shape\u2019 property of profiles as a way of measuring their quality. Starting from a nonparametric reference curve, we select our model from a universe of parametric deformations of such a curve with the property of preserving certain important shape characteristics.

The numerical solution is obtained through a policy iteration like contraction scheme, the convergence properties of which are studied in detail. Furthermore, the expected time until the optimal stopping of the campaign is estimated. Finally, a combined optimal stopping and control problem for the optimization of the advertisement effectiveness is also proposed and solved numerically. Our results are expected to provide useful guidelines for campaign managers, for the choice of effectiveness \u2026",

We show that when the spatial externality is not internalized by firms, spatial agglomerations may emerge endogenously in a competitive equilibrium. The result does not require increasing returns at the private or the social level, increasing marginal productivity of private capital with respect to the externality, or location advantages. In fact agglomerations may emerge with decreasing returns to scale, declining marginal productivity of private capital with respect to the externality, and no location advantage.

            "Abstract": "The present paper is devoted to the study of robust control problems of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations under model uncertainty. To be more precise, the robust control problem under investigation is expressed as a stochastic differential game in a real separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. By resorting to the theory of mild solutions, we prove that the elliptic partial differential equation associated with the problem at hand, also known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation, admits a unique solution, which is the value function of the game. Furthermore, we investigate the problem of existence of an optimal control pair that satisfies a saddle point property. Finally, as a demonstration of the proposed approach, we apply our results to the study of a certain robust control problem arising in the spatiotemporal management of natural resources.",

More precisely, we study the propagation (in the time domain) of electromagnetic fields in a bianisotropic medium, which presents dispersion. This is modeled by linear constitutive relations containing convolution terms. So the problem is represented by an integrodifferential equation in some appropriate Hilbert space and then is treated with the use of the vector-valued Laplace transform.",

For a specific class of random matching Edgeworthian economies, the expectation of the limiting equilibrium price coincides with that of related Walrasian economies. The novelty of our model is that we associate a bargaining skill factor to each participant which brings up a game alike the prisoner\u2019s dilemma into the usual Edgeworth exchange economy. We analyze the effect of the bargaining skill factors in the variations of the individual amount of goods and in the increase of the value of their utilities. Finally, we let the bargaining skills of the participants evolve along the trades and we study their variation.",

In treating such problems we assume that the temporal evolution of these fields is periodic, with a fixed and prescribed period \u03d6. This class covers a variety of important applications, such as wave guide problems, scattering problems, etc. Under the assumption of temporally periodic fields we may use the constitutive relations introduced in Section 2.3. 3, which do not contain the convolution terms. The absence of the convolution terms simplifies the treatment of the Maxwell equations,(PDEs) which in this case become partial differential equations depending only on the spatial variables. As we shall see in this chapter, these differential equations, after proper reductions, can lead to problems that can be treated using the theory of variational PDEs, and methods akin to those used in elliptic problems.In this \u2026",

We highlight that the construction of the migration policy is a constitutive element of the spatial process of reorganization of territorial policies through the combination and diffusion of state, regional and global. We show that the perception of permanent and static migration pressure, and countries\u2019 specialization in migration are the basis for diffusion of asylum and migration policies to a number of different countries imposing similar migration systems and establishing a global governance of migration regime. The paper highlights a geographic and political change in migration and border management, through the patterns of EU Member States cooperation, and in particular their reluctance to establish a common asylum system based on solidarity and the focus on substituting the lack of a common asylum system by bilateral externalization agreements the main objective of which is the management of migration and border control rather than guaranteeing asylum and refugee policies.

In order to produce a measure that is the \u201cclosest\u201d to all probability models in the given set, we find the barycenter of the set. We derive explicit expressions for the Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Wasserstein mean utility functionals and show that they can be expressed in terms of an expansion that provides a tractable link between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion. The proposed utility functionals are illustrated in terms of two applications. The first application allows us to define the social discount rate under model uncertainty. In the second application, the functionals are used in risk securitization. The barycenter in this case can be interpreted as \u2026",

Through the proposed method, the infinite-dimensional HJM equation is approximated by a finite system of partial differential equations (PDEs), which can be addressed by standard techniques. To illustrate the general construction, we approximate the value of the US treasury bond in an HJM framework, and the results are compared with those derived by the Monte Carlo method and the ensemble Kalman filter. The proposed method is computationally efficient compared with the standard techniques, and it provides a convenient way to compute the statistical moments of the solution numerically. Numerical results and useful formulas for estimating the stochastic duration and immunization are presented.",

More precisely, we consider a portfolio manager who has the possibility to invest part of her wealth in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky one, whose coefficients depend on some external stochastic factor. Moreover, we assume that the manager, from the beginning of the trading interval, observes an information signal associated with the future evolution of the risky asset. This information is not clear but is subject to some observation noise. Within a very general framework, by resorting to a mixture of dynamic programming and initial enlargement of filtrations techniques, we characterize the optimal value function and the feedback control law, by solving an expected utility maximization problem under the enlarged information set of the economic agent \u2026",
