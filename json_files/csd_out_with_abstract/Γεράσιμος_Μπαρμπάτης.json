            "Abstract": "We consider the L  p  Hardy inequality involving the distance to the boundary for a domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. We study the dependence on p of the corresponding best constant and we prove monotonicity, continuity and differentiability results. The focus is on non-convex domains in which case such a constant is in general not explicitly known.",

            "Abstract": "We consider second\u2010order uniformly elliptic operators subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such operators are considered on a bounded domain \u03a9 and on the domain \u03d5(\u03a9) resulting from \u03a9 by means of a bi\u2010Lipschitz map \u03d5. We consider the solutions u and  of the corresponding elliptic equations with the same right\u2010hand side f\u2009\u2208\u2009L2(\u03a9\u2009\u222a\u2009\u03d5(\u03a9)). Under certain assumptions, we estimate the difference  in terms of certain measure of vicinity of \u03d5 to the identity map. For domains within a certain class, this provides estimates in terms of the Lebesgue measure of the symmetric difference of \u03d5(\u03a9) and \u03a9, that is,\u2009|\u2009\u03d5(\u03a9)\u2009\u25b3\u2009\u03a9\u2009|\u2009. We provide an example that shows that the estimates obtained are in a certain sense sharp. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
