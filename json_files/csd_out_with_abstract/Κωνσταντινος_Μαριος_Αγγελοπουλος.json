            "Abstract": "Random walks in Wireless Sensor Networks can serve as fully local, very simple strategies for sink motion that lift from sensors the computational burden of propagating collected data via complex routing algorithms. In such schemes, sensors maintain a passive role waiting for the sink to visit them and collect their data. Therefore, energy dissipation is significantly reduced at the expense of increasing the latency of data delivery. To achieve satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs, the sink walks can be made adaptive, depending on critical network parameters (density, history of past visits in each network region) as well as characteristic attributes of the network topology. In this chapter, we study known random walks on two well established network models; the Grid and the Random Geometric Graphs. Towards better balances of memory/performance, we propose four new random walks that we experimentally evaluate in terms of several performance metrics that capture important differences in the network traversal process. The simulation findings demonstrate that even with limited memory usage, random walks can prove themselves very efficient when carefully designed.",

We model such networks as Random Geometric Graphs. We then introduce a novel IDS architectural approach by having only a minimum subset of the nodes acting as IDS agents.

In an effort to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a distributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health systems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline companies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy.

However, the solution of using GPS based modules in order to perform localization in WSNs is a rather expensive solution and in the case of indoor applications, such as smart buildings, is also not applicable. Therefore, several techniques have been studied in order to perform relative localization in WSNs; that is, to compute the position of a node inside the network area relatively to the position of other nodes. Many such techniques are based on indicators like the Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Link Quality Indicator (LQI). These techniques are based on the assumption that there is strong correlation between the Euclidian distance of the communicating motes and these indicators. Therefore, high values of RSSI and LQI should indicate physical proximity of two communicating \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Random walks in wireless sensor networks can serve as fully local, very simple strategies for sink motion that significantly reduce energy dissipation a lot but increase the latency of data collection. To achieve satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs the sink walks can be made adaptive, depending on network parameters such as density and/or history of past visits in each network region; but this increases the memory requirements. Towards better balances of memory/performance, we propose three new random walks: the Random Walk with Inertia, the Explore-and-Go Random Walk and the Curly Random Walk; we also introduce a new metric (Proximity Variation) that captures the different way each walk gets close to the network nodes over time. We implement the new walks and experimentally compare them to known ones. The simulation findings demonstrate that the new walks\u2019 performance (cover time \u2026",

This abundance of well-connected, well-equipped, affordable devices, when combined with crowdsourcing methods, enables the development of systems with the aid of the crowd. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of Crowdsourced Systems, systems whose constituent infrastructure, or a significant part of it, is pooled from the general public by following crowdsourcing methodologies. We discuss the particular distinctive characteristics they carry and also provide their \u201ccanonical\u201d architecture.

Issues related to device heterogeneity, security, and privacy have prevented the rise of crowd-sensing platforms for scientific data collection. For this reason, we implemented VIVO, an open framework for gathering crowd-sensed Big Data for IoT services, where security and privacy are managed within the framework. VIVO introduces the enrolled crowd-sensing model, which allows the deployment of multiple simultaneous experiments on the mobile phones of volunteers. The collected data can be accessed both at the end of the experiment, as in traditional testbeds, as well as in real-time, as required by many Big Data applications. We present here the VIVO architecture, highlighting its advantages over existing solutions, and four relevant real \u2026",

In an effort to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local \u2026",

In our approach, such abstractions are used to primarily create a flexible, holistic and scalable system and allow external end-users to compose and run their own smart/green building automation application services on top of this system. Towards this direction, in this paper we present a smart building test-bed consisting of several sensor motes and spanning across seven rooms. Our test-bed's design and implementation simultaneously addresses several corresponding system layers; from hardware interfaces, embedded IPv6 networking and energy balancing routing algorithms to a RESTful architecture and over the web development of sophisticated, smart, green scenarios.

We especially study the important, realistic case where the spatial distribution of sensors is non-uniform and their mobility is diverse and dynamic. The basic idea of our protocol is for the sink to benefit of the local information that sensors spread in the network as they move, in order to extract current local conditions and accordingly adjust its trajectory. Thus, sensory motion anyway present in the network serves as a low cost replacement of network information propagation. In particular, we investigate two variations of our method: a) the greedy motion of the sink towards the region of highest density each time and b) taking into account the aggregate density in wider network regions.

Currently existing landslide monitoring methods and techniques are characterized by significant limitations both in technical terms (quality and frequency of data) and in terms of usability (high inferred costs, requirement of very high expertise). In this work we present an innovative landslide monitoring system that leverages state-of-the-art IoT technologies. The system consists of a set of autonomous sensing devices equipped with a sensor suit specifically tailored for monitoring landslides. The devices take sensory measurements at frequent intervals - while operating at a very low duty cycle - and transmit them over the SigFox network to a data server powered by ELK stack for curation and visualization.

They are, however, among the most sensitive fruits when it comes to the quality of the end product. The recent commercial trends show a rising number of farmers who directly sell their products in the market and are more interested in using smart solutions for a continuous control of the factors that affect the quality of the final product. Cloud-based approaches for smart irrigation have been widely used in the recent years. However, the network traffic, security and regulatory challenges, which come hand in hand with sharing the crop data with third parties outside the edge of the network, lead strawberry farmers and data owners to rely on global clouds and potentially lose control over their data, which are usually transferred to third party data centers.

There is a large number of existing experimentation facilities which can be adapted to a seamless federation into a unified platform.

This way, infrastructure developers can utilize common tools of the federation, allowing them to not only focus on their core testbed functionalities, activities and services but also collaboratively combine them. In this work realized in the frame of the IoT Lab European research project, we provide a federation roadmap which paves the way towards a holistic integration of three testbeds, different both in terms of location and in terms of provided services and functionalities.

We first formally define this problem as the Charger Traversal Decision Problem and prove its computational hardness. We then define a weighting function which evaluates several network parameters in order to prioritize the nodes during the charging process. Based on this function we define three traversal strategies for the MC; a global-knowledge strategy that uses an Integer Linear Program to optimize its trajectory; a global-knowledge strategy which tessellates the network area and prioritizes the charging process over each tile; a local-knowledge strategy that uses local network information collected and ferried \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Random walks in Wireless Sensor Networks can serve as fully local, very simple strategies for sink motion that lift from sensors the computational burden of propagating collected data via complex routing algorithms. In such schemes, sensors maintain a passive role waiting for the sink to visit them and collect their data. Therefore, energy dissipation is significantly reduced at the expense of increasing the latency of data delivery. To achieve satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs, the sink walks can be made adaptive, depending on critical network parameters (density, history of past visits in each network region) as well as characteristic attributes of the network topology. In this chapter, we study known random walks on two well established network models; the Grid and the Random Geometric Graphs. Towards better balances of memory/performance, we propose four new random walks that we experimentally \u2026",

The purpose of this integration is dual. First, the embedded sensory capabilities of the resources provided by the crowd are combined with the sensing capabilities of the building for efficient smart actuations. Second, the system is able to interact with its users in a direct, personal way both for incentivising them to provide sensory data from their devices and to receive feed-back on their preferences and experienced comfort. The above are exposed to the experimenter as a set of services thus providing great agility on developing and evaluating a broad range of use case scenarios.

These networks consist of highly constrained devices organised in mesh networks following ad-hoc architectures, and as such carry specific characteristics that are not efficiently addressed by current state-of-the-art. In this work we first identify a trade-off between the communication and energy overhead of an IDS (as captured by the number of active IDS agents in the network) and the performance of the system in terms of successfully identifying attacks. In order to fine tune this trade-off, we first model such networks with the use of Random Geometric Graphs as this is a rigorous approach that allows us to capture underlying structural properties of the network. We then introduce a novel architectural approach for IDS by having only a subset of the nodes acting as IDS agents. These nodes are able to efficiently detect attacks at the networking layer in a collaborative manner by monitoring locally available network information provided by IoT routing protocols such as RPL. Our detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance gains in terms of communication overhead and energy dissipation while maintaining high detection rates.",

However, successfully and sustainably engaging the crowd introduces costs in the form of incentives. Also, the fragmented landscape of crowdsensing applications aggravates the problem of dark data. In this work we address this problem by investigating the potentiality of crowdsourced systems that entail circularity principles.

            "Abstract": "The paradigm of Internet of Things has now reached a maturity level where the pertinent research goal is the successful application of IoT technologies in systems of high technological readiness level. However, while basic aspects of IoT connectivity and networking have been well studied and adequately addressed, this has not been the case for cyber security aspects of IoT. This is nicely demonstrated by the number of IoT testbeds focusing on networking aspects and the lack of IoT testbeds focusing on security aspects. Towards addressing the existing and growing skills-shortage in IoT cyber security, we present an IoT Cyber Range (IoT-CR); an IoT testbed designed for research and training in IoT security. The IoT-CR allows the user to specify and work on customisable IoT networks, both virtual and physical, and supports the concurrent execution of multiple scenarios in a scalable way following a modular architecture. We first provide an overview of existing, state of the art IoT testbeds and cyber security related initiatives. We then present the design and architecture of the IoT Cyber Range, also detailing the corresponding RESTful APIs that help de-associate the IoT-CR tiers and obfuscate underlying complexities. The design is focused around the end-user and is based on the four design principles for Cyber Range development discussed in the introduction. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the facility via a red/blue team scenario involving a variant of man-in-the-middle attack using IoT devices. Future work includes the use of the IoT-CR by cohorts of trainees in order to evaluate the effectiveness of specific scenarios in acquiring IoT \u2026",

We especially study the important, realistic case where the spatial distribution of sensors is non-uniform and their mobility is diverse and dynamic. The basic idea of our protocol is for the sink to benefit of the local information that sensors spread in the network as they move, in order to extract current local conditions and accordingly adjust its trajectory. Thus, sensory motion anyway present in the network serves as a low cost replacement of network information propagation. In particular, we investigate two variations of our method: a) the greedy motion of the sink towards the region of highest density each time and b) taking into account the aggregate density in wider network regions.

The Internet of Things-IoT paradigm can underpin the transition to a Circular Economy by enabling fine-grained and continuous asset tracking. However, there are issues related to security and privacy of IoT devices that generate and handle sensitive and personal data. The use of Blockchain technology provides an answer to this issue, however, its application raises issues related to the highly-constrained nature of these networks. In this paper, Edge Computing is presented as a solution to this issue, providing a way in which Blockchain and Edge Computing can be used together to address the constrained nature of IoT. Furthermore, we present the challenges that this combination poses and the opportunities that it brings. We propose an architecture that decreases the IoT devices requirements for memory \u2026",

These networks consist of highly constrained devices able to communicate wirelessly in an ad-hoc fashion, thus following mesh networks. Current state-of-the-art (IDS) have been developed taking into consideration regular computer networks, and as such they do not efficiently addresses the paradigm of ad-hoc networks. In this work we firstly identify a trade-off between the communication and energy overheads of an IDS (as captured by the number of active IDS agents in the network) and the performance of the system in terms of successfully identifying attacks. In order to fine tune this trade-off, we model such networks as Random Geometric Graphs; a rigorous approach that allows us to capture underlying structural properties of the network. We then introduce a novel IDS architectural approach by having only a subset of the nodes acting as IDS agents. These nodes are able to efficiently detect attacks at the networking layer in a collaborative manner by monitoring locally available network information provided by IoT routing protocols such as RPL. Our detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance gains in terms of communication overhead and energy dissipation while maintaining high detection rates. We also show that the performance of our IDS in ad-hoc networks does not rely on the size of the network but on fundamental underling network properties, such as the network topology and the average degree of the nodes.",

The main reason behind the huge adoption of this technology is the simplicity of the IEEE 802.11 protocols, which offer low-cost ownership and maintenance combined with the ability to provide high data rates to end users. The increasing demand in traffic volumes leads to the continuous deployment of access points (APs), resulting in densification of the IEEE 802.11 networks. This densification, instead of enhancing the efficiency of wireless local area networks (WLANs), degrades their overall performance due to cochannel interference between overlapped basic services sets (OBSSs). One of the main goals of the IEEE 802.11ax amendment now under development is to address the WLAN densification problem by improving spatial reuse (SR).",
