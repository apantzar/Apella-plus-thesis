Side channel attacks in computer security refer to attacks on data confidentiality through information gained from the physical implementation of a system, rather an attack on the algorithm or software itself. Depending on the source and the type of information leakage, certain general types of side channel attacks have been established: power, electromagnetic, cache, timing, sensor-based, acoustic and memory analysis attacks. Given the sensitive nature of ICS and the vast amount of information stored on IT systems, consequences of side channel attacks can be quite significant.

            "Abstract": "With HMI systems becoming increasingly connected with the internet, more and more critical infrastructures are starting to query PLC/RTU units through the Web through MODBUS ports. Commands sent from such interfaces are inevitably exposed to potential attacks even if encryption measures are in place. During the last decade, side channels have been widely exploited, focusing mostly on information disclosure. In this paper, we show that despite encryption, targeted side channel attacks on encrypted packets may lead to information disclosure of functionality over encrypted TCP/IP running MODBUS RTU protocol. Specifically, we found that any web interface that implements unpadded encryption with specific block cipher modes (eg CFB, GCM, OFB and CTR modes) or most stream ciphers (eg RC4) to send MODBUS functions over TCP/IP is subject to differential packet size attacks. A major cause for this attack is the very small number of potential MODBUS commands and differences in packet sizes, which leads to distinctions in traffic. To support the importance of these findings, we conducted research on Shodan looking for relevant devices with open MODBUS ports over TCP/IP that utilize encrypted web traffic. The result was that a significant amount of web interfaces communicate with MODBUS ports and many use unpadded ciphers and SSL with AES-GCM or RC4. We also implemented a PoC on a simulated architecture to validate our attack models.",

The existing legal framework seem inadequate to deal effectively with cyber operations and, from a strictly legal standpoint, it indicates that addressing cyberattacks does not fall within the jurisdiction of just one legal branch. This is mainly due to the fact that the concept of cyber warfare itself, is open to many different interpretations ranging from cyber operations performed by states within the context of armed conflict, under International Humanitarian Law, to illicit activities of all kinds performed by non-state actors including cybercriminals and terrorist groups. The paper initially presents major cyber-attack incidents and their impact on States. On this basis, it examines the existing legal framework at the European and International level. Furthermore, it approaches \u2018cyber warfare\u2019from the perspective of International Law and focuses on two major issues relating to cyber operations ie \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cattribution\u201d.

The goal of the DSOM workshops is to bring together researchers from industry and academia working in the areas of n-works, systems, and service management, to discuss recent advances and foster future growth. In contrast to the larger management conferences, such as IM (Integrated Network Management) and NOMS (Network Operations and M-agement Symposium), DSOM workshops have a single-track program in order to stimulate more intense interaction among participants. The theme of DSOM 2008 was \u201cManaging Large-Scale Service Deployment\u201d focusing both on management of overlay networks and on virtualized service-frastructures.

The network manager has to establish specific network security mechanisms such as authentication, encryption, authorization, access control, firewalls, etc. in order to protect the network resources against Security threats. But, since network Security mechanisms are not impermeable, the network manager has to establish also procedures for continuously monitoring the network security. In this paper we propose a network management system which enables the monitoring and control of security in TCP/IP networks. The system admits the real-time monitoring of security management information by using the SNMP protocol. Moreover, the system includes facilities for collecting and efficiently storing historical security management information in a temporal database for off-line analysis. Finally, the adopted two level hierarchical network management architecture and the model for the security temporal management information base are also described in this paper.",

Our perspective is based on a Temporal Management Information Base (TMIB) for fault management that represents the evolution in time of network resources. The proposed model may be implemented in a centralized or distributed environment. Moreover, the necessary primitive fault management services are defined. Finally, discussing the benefits of our approach, we briefly present a simple prototype implementing some aspects of the proposed model.",

Currently, the literature concentrates mainly on the \u2018nuts and bolts\u2019 of their security models. Not extensive work is available on the security awareness of smartphone users, even though their role in the ecosystem is important. This is so, as users\u2019 actions directly affect their security and privacy. This paper extends a previous work on the awareness of smartphone users who install apps from official repositories. More specifically, we explore if a security background affects the smartphone security awareness of the survey participants by splitting them in two groups, comprising of security savvy and non-security savvy users. The results of the statistical analysis indicate, inter alia, that the participants\u2019 security background has slight impact on their security awareness in the smartphone ecosystem.",

            "Abstract": "The picture of global computing is rapidly changing. In the last few years, with the progress made in the area of computer networks, standalone desktop computers became largely interconnected. And then grid computing came along. Managing and monitoring a network had never been a trivial task and many efforts have been made in this direction. A variety of protocols have been proposed and standards have arisen in order to facilitate this process. Now the task has become even more complex. Not only do we have the need to monitor and manage the underlying network, but also the availability and utilisation of shared resources. From simple resources such as CPU cycles and storage space, all the way to complicated equipment used for specific purposes, such as medical or scientific instruments. Our vision is of a management framework for grid deployments, that is easy to use, scalable, secure and modular. We propose a framework that has been designed in order to satisfy the above criteria. Furthermore, it is based on open standards, which makes it easy to implement and integrate with existing management systems.",

The proposed model captures the above multi-objective policy concepts by using a pricing scheme consisting of two parts, a fixed part, that reflects specific policy parameters, and a variable part, that reflects the usage of the congested links. The latter part is used in order to reduce congestion and provide the revenue needed in order to upgrade the congested resources. We discuss the case study of applying the above model for calculating the tariffs for 1999 for the Greek Academic Research Network (GR-NET).",

Yet, they cannot detect flaws that manifest due to erroneous translation of the software\u2019s functional requirements into the source code. The automated detection of logical errors that are attributed to a faulty implementation of applications\u2019 functionality, is a relatively uncharted territory. In previous research, we proposed a combination of automated analyses for logical error detection. In this paper, we develop a novel business-logic oriented method able to filter mathematical depictions of software logic in order to augment logical error detection, eliminate previous limitations in analysis and provide a formal tested logical error detection classification without subjective discrepancies. As a proof of concept, our method has been implemented in a prototype tool called PLATO that can detect various types of logical errors. Potential logical errors are thus detected that are ranked using a fuzzy logic system with two scales characterizing their impact:(i) a Severity scale, based on the execution paths\u2019 characteristics and Information Gain,(ii) a Reliability scale, based on the measured program\u2019s Computational Density. The method\u2019s effectiveness is shown using diverse experiments. Albeit not without restrictions, the proposed automated analysis seems able to detect a wide variety of logical errors, while at the same time limiting the false positives.",

            "Abstract": "The latest generation of light sources, the Free Electron Lasers that are capable of delivering high-intensity photon beams of unprecedented brilliance and quality, provide a substantially novel way to probe matter with a very high, largely unexplored potential for science and innovation. The CompactLight Collaboration intends to design a hard X-ray FEL facility beyond today\u2019s state of the art using the latest concepts for bright electron photoinjectors, very high-gradient X-band structures at 12 GHz, and innovative compact short-period undulators. When compared to existing facilities, the proposed facility will benefit from a lower electron beam energy, due to the enhanced undulator performance, will be significantly more compact with a smaller footprint, as a consequence of both the lower energy and the high-gradient X-band structures, and will have a much lower electrical power demand.

            "Abstract": "Quality of service (QoS) plays a key role to the economic analysis of demand for network resources (bandwidth and buffers). In the absence of any QoS consideration, users are not able to rank their preferences for resource bundles and no utility function can exist. Without such a QoS-based utility-maximizing model, demand for network resources is not possible to be derived and network usage cannot be efficient. In this paper, we assume that QoS-based preferences are expressed by means of Cobb-Douglas utility functions and we propose a demand-based approach to optimal resource allocation with QoS requirements. QoS is the 'glue' that ties together standard economic properties and network performance characteristics. Finally, we examine the economic variables of the model and we determine the optimal amounts for each resource by means of users' demand functions.",

            "Abstract": "The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a TeV-scale high-luminosity linear  collider under development at CERN. Following the CLIC conceptual design published in 2012, this report provides an overview of the CLIC project, its current status, and future developments. It presents the CLIC physics potential and reports on design, technology, and implementation aspects of the accelerator and the detector. CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in stages, at centre-of-mass energies of 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively. CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which 12 GHz accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the first stage, an alternative with X-band klystron powering is also considered. CLIC accelerator optimisation, technical developments and system tests have resulted in an increased energy efficiency (power around 170 MW) for the 380 GeV stage, together with a reduced cost estimate at the level of 6 billion CHF. The detector concept has been refined using improved software tools. Significant progress has been made on detector technology developments for the tracking and calorimetry systems. A wide range of CLIC physics studies has been conducted, both through full detector simulations and parametric studies, together providing a broad overview of the CLIC physics potential. Each of the three energy stages adds cornerstones of the full CLIC physics programme, such as Higgs width and couplings, top-quark properties, Higgs self-coupling, direct searches, and many precision electroweak measurements. The interpretation of the combined results gives crucial and accurate insight \u2026",

            "Abstract": "Smart cards are cards with memory and a processor, ideal for authentication and secure applications. Mobile devices have an extraordinary spread; people carry them along at all times. The ability to combine the features of those two devices is quite compelling. We used technologies of the Java family in order to achieve this. In our work, we designed an architecture for the management of smart cards by mobile devices. The system is built up from three components, the Java card applet, the mobile application and the Java card-mobile device gateway. For the purposes of our work and as proof of concept, we developed a sample electronic wallet application. Finally, we extended the proposed system's functionality and described a business case, where the system could be used in the future.",

            "Abstract": "Following the identification on an international basis of cyberspace as a new \u2018domain of warfare\u2019, it has become widely (though not fully) accepted that the traditional rules of International Humanitarian Law are also applicable to Computer Network Attacks (CNAs). Despite the fact that there has been considerable progress at the European and International level towards the development of National Cyber Security Strategies and the adoption of an effective comprehensive legal framework of prevention measures against cyber attacks, there is confusion regarding the application of these rules. More specifically, it has not been clarified: a) in which cases do cyber attacks constitute a \u2018threat or use of force\u2019so that the prohibition of article 2 (4) of the UN Charter can apply, b) in which cases do cyber attacks constitute a \u2018threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression\u2019so that the Security Council may decide upon measures to restore international peace and security under Article 42 of the UN Charter, and c) in which cases cyber attacks can be treated as an \u2018armed attack\u2019, making it possible for a UN Member State to respond by exercising its legitimate right of self\u2010-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The difficulty in applying the traditional rules of International Humanitarian Law to categorize cyber attacks stems from a number of factors. The most important of them is the failure to estimate properly the impact of a cyber attack in the host country and in the international environment. Additionally, the inability to positively identify the key actor of an attack makes it often quite hard to handle the issue of \u2018attribution\u2019. The aim of this paper is to \u2026",

The existing legal framework seem inadequate to deal effectively with cyber operations and, from a strictly legal standpoint, it indicates that addressing cyber attacks does not fall within the jurisdiction of just one legal branch. This is mainly because of the fact that the concept of cyber warfare itself is open to many different interpretations, ranging from cyber operations performed by the States within the context of armed conflict, under International Humanitarian Law, to illicit activities of all kinds performed by non-State actors including cybercriminals and terrorist groups.

Proposed management framework aims at acting as a facilitator among e-learning systems, learners, underlying communication infrastructure and access devices, content and delivery methods, forming an integration management middleware, while at the same time acts as a broker for e-learning and content providing systems. Our framework is session profile centric, since a key characteristic is the dynamic creation of user session by detecting and managing information and parameters that are either derived by stored profiles or change dynamically at each user session. In this paper, we present content and e-learning provision services\u2019 context, along with the proposed architecture overview. We also present session profile and a UML definition of its creation process.",
