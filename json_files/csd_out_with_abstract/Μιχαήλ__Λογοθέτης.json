It utilizes the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy and supports calls generated by an infinite or finite number of users. The BR policy achieves QoS equalization by equalizing congestion probabilities among calls of different service-classes. In the proposed models a multiple access interference is considered, and the notion of local blocking, user\u2019s activity and interference cancelation. Although the analysis of the proposed models reveals that the steady state probabilities do not have a product form solution, the authors show that the calculation of time and call congestion probabilities can be based on approximate but recursive formulas, whose accuracy is verified through simulation and found to be quite satisfactory.",

            "Abstract": "We consider the fair bandwidth allocation problem of ABR calls by a Connection Admission Controller (CAC) at call setup. Its general solution is given by applying the \u201cmax-min fairness allocation policy\u201d. Extensions of this policy take into account the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) traffic description parameters, which are essential for ABR. These extensions are distinguished according to the existence or non-existence of weights in the policy. The weights may be defined independent of MCR or dependent on MCR.In this paper firstly we present a linear programming model, which describes in a parametric way both weighted and unweighted bandwidth allocation policies for ABR services. Because of the parametric nature of the LP model, it can be easily extended in order to take into account various bandwidth allocation policies. Secondly, we propose an unweighted fair bandwidth allocation policy in which ABR calls are grouped in categories, according to their traffic description parameters and the max-min fairness allocation policy is applied among the groups while the MCR and PCR can be taken into account for each group. Thirdly we propose a weight-based fair bandwidth allocation policy in which the number of links of an ABR connection stands for the weight.",

If the available link bandwidth is not enough to accept a new call with its peak-bandwidth requirement, then the call can retry one or more times (single/multi-retry loss models) to be connected in the system with reduced bandwidth. If its last bandwidth requirement remains higher than the available link bandwidth, the call can still be accepted in the system, by compressing the bandwidth of all in-service calls together with its last bandwidth requirement. The proposed models do not have a product form solution, and therefore we propose approximate recursive formulas for the efficient calculation of call blocking probabilities.

Depending on their capacity, the RRHs may form one or more clusters. Each RRH accommodates multiservice traffic, i.e., calls from different service-classes with different radio and computational resource requirements. Arriving calls follow a Poisson process and simultaneously require radio and computational resource units in order to be accepted in the serving RRH. If their resource requirements cannot be met then calls are blocked and lost. Otherwise, calls remain in the serving RRH for a generally distributed service time. Assuming the single-cluster C-RAN, we model it as a multiservice loss system, prove that a product form solution exists for the steady-state probabilities and determine call blocking \u2026",

We have proposed the Connection Dependent Threshold Model (CDTM) as a generalization of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model, in order to assess the call-level performance of elastic service-classes accommodated in a single link. In this paper we extend the CDTM in fixed-routing multirate loss networks. In the CDTM, calls of each service-class that arrive in the network can reduce their bandwidth, while increase their service time requirement, according to a set of thresholds which indicates the occupied bandwidth in each link of their route (sequence of links). The absence of a product form solution in the CDTM, leads us to an approximate but recurrent formula for the calculation of the call-level performance index, namely the call blocking probabilities. To overcome the complexity of the proposed recurrent formula, the reduced load approximation method is used. Simulation results validate our analytical methodology.",

Users request the content by its name or some other form of identifier. Then, the network is responsible for locating the requested content and sending it to the users. Despite a large number of works on ICN in recent years, the problem of scalability of ICN systems has not been studied and addressed adequately. This is especially true when considering real-world deployments and the so-called alternative networks such as community networks. In this work, we explore the applicability of ICN principles in the challenging and unpredictable environments of community networks. In particular, we focus on stateless content dissemination based on Bloom filters (BFs). We highlight the scalability limitations of the classical single-stage BF based approach and argue that by enabling multiple BF stages would lead to performance enhancements. That is, a multi-stage BF based content dissemination mechanism could support large network topologies with heterogeneous traffic and diverse channel conditions. In addition to scalability improvements, this approach also is more secure with regard to Denial of Service attacks.",

            "Abstract": "The IEEE 802.11 protocol is the dominant standard for wireless local area networks (WLANs) and has generated much interests in investigating and improving its performance. The IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) is mainly based on the distributed coordination function (DCF). DCF uses a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol in order to resolve contention between wireless stations and to verify successful transmissions. In this paper we present an extensive investigation of the performance of the IEEE 802.11b MAC protocol, in respect of end-to-end delay. The end-to-end delay analysis of the IEEE 802.11b has not been completed, because no adequate queuing delay is provided. Our delay analysis is based on Bianchi's model for the DCF, while a more comprehensive model could be used as well. We use z-transform of backoff duration to get mean value, variance \u2026",

Each RRH accommodates Poisson arriving calls which require a radio and a computational resource unit in order to be accepted in the C-RAN. If these units are not available, call blocking occurs. To compute call blocking probabilities we propose a convolution algorithm which performs quite satisfactory, in terms of computational time.",

In such networks, the distinction between new and handoff traffic is very important. A simple CAC scheme can distinguish calls between the two traffic types by setting different thresholds for call admission. This simple CAC scheme is evaluated in respect of blocking probabilities of both new and handoff calls. To this end, we formulate aggregated Markov chains, which describe both new-call and handoff-call arrival processes, under the assumption that they are Poisson or quasi-random. Based on these Markov chains we derive recurrent and computationally efficient formulas for the calculation of the system state probabilities. Consequently, we calculate newcall and handoff-call blocking probabilities. The analytical results are verified through simulation and found to be quite satisfactory.",

We consider traffic of multiple service-classes and focus on the calculation of the mean total delay from the so-called Optical Network Unit (ONU) to the Optical Line Terminator (OLT). The PON operates under the fixed service of the IPACT (Interleaved Polling With Adaptive Cycle) algorithm, which uses the MultiPoint Control Protocol (MPCP). The delay analysis is based on a unified approach for EPONs and WDM-EPONs, through the formation of two classical queuing models: an M/D [x]/C for the packets waiting in the local queues of the ONUs and an M/D/C for the frame transmission to the OLT. The number of servers C corresponds to the number of wavelengths used in the uplink. Through simulation, we verify our analysis and show the accuracy and the consistency of the results.",

In the Connection Dependent Threshold Model (CDTM), calls arriving at a communication link can reduce their bandwidth while increasing their service time requirement, according to a set of thresholds indicating the occupied link bandwidth. We\u2019ve already proposed approximate and recursive calculation of the call blocking probabilities (CBP) based on: 1) the local balance between adjacent system-states, 2) the migration approximation (calls accepted in the system with other than the initial bandwidth are negligible within a space, called the migration space) and 3) the upward approximation (calls accepted in the system with their initial bandwidth are negligible within a space, called the upward space). Because of these three assumptions, significant relative CBP approximation errors occur. Therefore, we propose a new approximation method (new CDTM) whereby we improve the accuracy of the existing CDTM substantially. This is done, by considering that the population of calls in the migration and upward spaces is not negligible; thus, reducing the migration and upward approximation errors. Simulation results show that the CBP relative approximation errors of the new CDTM are significantly reduced, especially under realistic traffic-load conditions.",

Based on their radio capacity, the RRHs may form one or many clusters: a single cluster when all RRHs have the same capacity and multi-clusters where RRHs of the same radio capacity are grouped in the same cluster. Each RRH services the so-called multiservice traffic, i.e., calls from many service classes with various radio and computational resource requirements. Calls arrive in the RRHs according to a quasi-random process. This means that new calls are generated by a finite number of mobile users. Arriving calls require simultaneously computational and radio resource units in order to be accepted in the system, i.e., in the serving RRH. If their requirements are met, then these calls are served in the (serving) RRH for a service time which is generally distributed. Otherwise, call blocking occurs. We start with the single-cluster C-RAN and model it as a multiservice loss system, prove that the model has a product form solution, and determine time congestion probabilities via a convolution algorithm whose accuracy is validated with the aid of simulation.

            "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an emerging networking technology that has been designed to directly operate on named content/information objects, rather than relying on the knowledge of the content location. According to the ICN principles, a user requests the information object by its name or some other form of object identifier. After that, the ICN system is responsible for finding the particular object and sending it back to the user. Despite a large number of works on ICN in recent years, ICN systems still face security challenges. This is especially true when considering different types of alternative networks, such as the wireless community networks (WCNs). In this work, we explore the applicability of ICN principles in the challenging and unpredictable environments of WCNs. We consider stateless content dissemination using Bloom filters (BFs) and analyze two BF based approaches: the traditional single-stage BF and its generalization, the multi-stage BF. We focus on the security aspects of BF based approaches and in particular on distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Finally, we investigate the attack probability for various system and network parameters, such as the number of hash functions, the BF maximum fill factor, and the number of hops toward the victim node.",

We study the performance, at call-level, of a CDMA cell with interference cancellation capabilities, while assuming that the cell accommodates different service-classes of batched Poisson arriving calls. The partial batch blocking discipline is applied for Call Admission Control (CAC). To guarantee certain Quality of Service (QoS) for each service-class, the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy is incorporated in the CAC; i.e., a fraction of system resources is reserved for highspeed service-classes. We propose a new multirate loss model for the calculation of time and call congestion probabilities. The notion of local (soft) and hard blocking, users activity, interference cancellation, as well as the BR policy, are incorporated in the model.

In this model, the maximum transmission power of a base station in the downlink is considered as the shared system resource.

            "Abstract": "We examine the applicability of a fair bandwidth allocation policy on a Virtual Circuit (VC) routing network. Having examined several bandwidth allocation policies among calls of different serviceclasses, in a single link, we choose the max-min fairness policy (MMF) with minimum and maximum bandwidth requirements (GMMF\u2013generalizedMMF) in order to apply it on a whole network. To achieve it, we propose a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure consisting of several scenarios, dependent on the number of paths between the origindestination network nodes. To evaluate the proposed CAC scheme we compare the maximum Call Blocking Probability (CBP) of the whole network when we apply the GMMF policy, with the maximum CBP when we do not apply any fair bandwidth allocation policy. The results, obtained through simulation, show significant reduction of the maximum CBP in the case of GMMF policy.",

Under such conditions in the cell, due to a wide range of supported services and high dependencies on efficient vertical and horizontal handovers, appropriate management of handover traffic is very crucial. Furthermore, new emerging technologies, such as cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) and self-organizing networks (SON), provide good implementation and deployment opportunities for novel functions and services. We design a multi-threshold teletraffic model for heterogeneous code division multiple access (CDMA) networks that enable QoS differentiation of handover traffic when elastic and adaptive services are present.

            "Abstract": "The call-level performance modelling and evaluation of 3G cellular networks is important for the proper network dimensioning and efficient use of the network resources, such as bandwidth and power. In the case of the wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) cellular networks, this task is complicated, not only because of the so called soft blocking, the multiple access interference (MAI) and the heterogeneous traffic, but also due to the handoff process. In this paper, we propose a new teletraffic model for the call-level analysis of handoff traffic in the uplink of W-CDMA networks where multiple services with finite number of traffic sources are accommodated. Parameters related to the soft blocking and MAI are included into the model. The proposed model is described by a discrete time Markov chain. An efficient recurrent formula for the calculation of the system state probabilities is derived. Based on this \u2026",

Calls of all service-classes compete for the available link bandwidth, under two different policies: a) the complete sharing (CS) policy and b) the bandwidth/trunk reservation (BR) policy. In the CS policy, a call is blocked and lost if and only if the available link bandwidth is less than the call\u2019s bandwidth requirement. Such a single-link loss system has been analytically described by the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM). On the other hand, the BR policy is used in order to achieve call blocking probability (CBP) equalization among service classes, or, alternatively, guarantee a certain quality of service for each service-class. Such a single-link loss system has been analytically described by the EMLM under the BR policy (EMLM/BR). In this paper, we focus on the problem of determining, in an efficient analytical way, derivatives of blocking probabilities, throughput rates and average number of calls in the system, with respect to offered traffic-load, arrival rate and service rate of any service-class under both the EMLM and EMLM/BR models. We further show through analytical formulas how derivatives can be used to successfully approximate the above mentioned performance measures when small variations of offered traffic-load are considered.",

The X2 interface connects directly two neighboring evolved NodeBs and is mainly responsible for the transfer of user-plane and control-plane data during a handover. In the model, the X2 interface is modelled as a link of fixed capacity. Handover calls are accepted in the X2 link whenever available bandwidth exists. Secondly, we propose a multirate loss model where calls arrive in the X2 link according to a quasi-random process and compete for the available bandwidth under the Complete Sharing (CS) policy. The CS policy allows calls to enter the system when available bandwidth exists.

            "Abstract": "In this paper we review two extensions of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM), whereby we can assess the call-level QoS of telecom networks supporting elastic service-classes. The first extension is the Connection Dependent Threshold Model (CDTM) where calls arriving at a communication link can reduce their bandwidth while increase their service time requirement, according to a set of thresholds indicating the link occupied bandwidth; the in-service calls do not alter the assigned bandwidth. The second extension is the Extended Erlang Multirate Loss Model (E-EMLM), where an arriving call at a communication link requires certain bandwidth and, if not available, the call can reduce its bandwidth requirement while increase its service time requirement; this is done in accordance with the bandwidth reduction of the in-service calls. For the evaluation of the two models, we compare the call-level QoS index of Call Blocking Probability (CBP), when the average allocated bandwidth of a link is the same for the two models. Our results show that if both stream and elastic traffic are present, the CDTM performs better than the E-EMLM for the elastic traffic. If only elastic services are accommodated in the link, the models perform equally well.",

Adaptive calls that can tolerate bandwidth compression, but their service time cannot be altered, compose the so\u2010called adaptive traffic (e.g., adaptive video).

It also considers the multiservice system of the E\u2010EMLM under the BR policy and TH policy.

We investigate the use of software-defined networking (SDN) to detect and mitigate advanced ransomware threat. We present our ransomware analysis results and our developed SDN-based security framework. For the proof of concept, the infamous WannaCry ransomware was used.

The cell accommodates random input-traffic originated from K service-classes. We distinguish call requests to new and handover, and therefore, the cell supports 2K types of arrivals. If the number of in-service calls (new or handover) of a service-class exceeds a threshold (different for new and handover calls of a service-class), a new or handover arriving call of the same service-class is not always blocked, as it happens in the TH policy, but it is accepted in the system with a predefined state-dependent probability. The cell is analyzed as a multirate loss system, via a reversible continuous-time Markov chain, which leads to a product form solution (PFS) for the steady state distribution.

            "Abstract": "We study the problem of load balancing in 802.11-based wireless networks, operating in infrastructure mode. In a large wireless network with multiple collocated Access Points (AP), a load balancing policy is necessary for the distribution of the wireless stations (WS) to the AP\u2019s, so as the network performance to be maximized. Already proposed algorithms, which are based only on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), may cause all the WS to be associated to a single or to a very few number of AP, and result in an overall network performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a load balancing procedure, which acts in two separate levels. First, the AP\u2019s are either distributed across the channels (if the number of AP is small) or located in the same channel that is specified by taking into account the channel-location and the received RSSI of the neighbor AP. Second, the WS are distributed across all the available AP based not only on RSSI measurements but also on the number of WS already associated to the AP and other link quality measurements. Besides, in this paper we describe the signaling extension needed for the implementation of the proposed load balancing procedure.",

To benefit from network function virtualization, we consider virtualized BBU (V-BBU) resources where the BBU functionality and services have been virtualized in the form of virtual network functions. We consider all RRHs in the C-RAN as a single cluster. Each RRH of such a cluster accommodates quasi-random traffic. This means that new calls in a RRH are generated by a finite number of mobile users. An arriving call requires a radio resource unit from the serving RRH and a computational resource unit from the V-BBU. If these resource units are available, then the call is accepted and remains in the system for a generally distributed service \u2026",

            "Abstract": "In the recent years, mobile cellular networks are undergoing fundamental changes and many established concepts are being revisited. New emerging paradigms, such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Internet of Things (IoT), and Mobile Social Networking (MSN), bring challenges in the design of cellular networks architectures. Current Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks are not able to accommodate these new trends in a scalable and efficient way. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of the current LTE architecture. Second, driven by the new communication needs and by the advances in aforementioned areas, we propose a new architecture for next-generation cellular networks. Some of its characteristics include support for distributed content routing, Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) and multiple Radio Access \u2026",

In our MAC delay analysis, we are based on elementary conditional probabilities, avoiding the complex Markov Chains method. For a thoroughly study of the MAC delay, we take the Z-transform of the backoff duration in order to provide higher moments of the MAC delay distribution. The first moment corresponds to the mean MAC delay, while the second moment to the Standard Deviation of the MAC delay, which depicts the jitter. We also estimate the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the MAC delay through the Lattice Poisson Algorithm. For the queuing delay, we consider a queue for each Access Category (AC) with one common server and an input process which is described by an O-OFF model depicting the bursty nature of traffic. The service time follows the MAC delay distribution. Analyzing this queue, we provide results both for saturated and non-saturated channel condition. The end-toend delay is estimated by the sum of queuing and MAC delay. The analytical results are validated through simulation.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider a single-link multirate loss system, which accommodates different service-classes with different traffic and peak-bandwidth requirements. Calls of each service-class arrive in the system according to a random (Poisson) or a quasi-random process, and have an exponentially distributed service time. Poisson or quasi-random arriving calls belong to service-classes of infinite or finite number of traffic sources, respectively. The service-classes are also distinguished, according to the behaviour of calls under service, in elastic and adaptive service-classes. Elastic calls can compress their bandwidth by simultaneously increasing their service time, while, adaptive calls do not affect their service time. A new call (either elastic or adaptive) is accepted in the system with its peak-bandwidth requirement, if there is available link bandwidth. If not, the call retries one or more times (single and multi-retry loss model, respectively) with a reduced bandwidth. If the available link bandwidth is lower than the call\u2019s last bandwidth requirement, the call can still compress its last bandwidth requirement (down to a certain bandwidth), together with the bandwidth of all inservice calls. Call blocking occurs, if, after compression, the call\u2019s bandwidth still exceeds the available link bandwidth. The system incorporates the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy, whereby we can achieve certain Quality of Service (QoS) for each serviceclass, through a proper bandwidth allocation defined by the BR parameters. To calculate in an approximate but efficient way, time and call congestion probabilities, as well as link utilization, we propose recurrent formulas for the \u2026",

The RRHs in the C-RAN are grouped in different clusters according to their capacity while the BBUs form a centralized pool of computational resource units. Each RRH services a finite number of mobile users, ie, the call arrival process is the quasi-random process. A new call of a single service-class requires a radio and a computational resource unit in order to be accepted in the C-RAN for a generally distributed service time. If these resource units are unavailable, then the call is blocked and lost. To analyze the multi-cluster C-RAN, we model it as a single-rate loss system, show that a product form solution exists for the steady state probabilities and propose a convolution algorithm for the accurate determination of congestion probabilities. The accuracy of this algorithm is verified via simulation. The proposed model generalizes our recent model where the RRHs in the C-RAN are grouped in a single cluster and each RRH accommodates quasi-random traffic.",

In this paper we investigate the performance of an all-optical packet switch, in terms of the packet blocking probability. We analyse several QoS differentiation schemes, including wavelength conversion, packet dropping and wavelength reservation.

            "Abstract": "The session initiation protocol (SIP) is a general-purpose protocol that can be used for video conferencing, instant messaging and gaming. However, its primary use today is in VoIP systems, where it serves as a support protocol for registering and locating users, and for call set up and management. Conventional SIP implementations in servers and softphones require the support of an operating system (OS) such as Windows or Linux, or some form of an OS kernel. SIP phones are also frequently implemented in hardware/firmware typically with an embedded OS. The SIP implementations in OS-based systems take advantage of their rich supporting environment and capabilities, and are convenient to use.Bare PC systems (also known as bare machine computing systems) enable self-supporting applications to run directly on the hardware of an ordinary PC (desktop or laptop) without using an OS or kernel. A bare PC provides immunity against OS-based attacks, and bare PC applications perform better than applications running on conventional systems due to the elimination of OS overhead. We describe the design, implementation and performance of a SIP user agent (UA) for secure VOIP on bare PC systems. The SIP UA is integrated with the bare PC softphone application. In [1], the design and implementation of a SIP server and UA for VoIP on a bare PC were described. However, that study did not consider UA performance or the elimination of additional protocols such as TLS or IPsec to secure the key exchange over SIP to protect the VoIP call. Other studies [2],[3] dealt extensively with bare PC SIP server (but not SIP UA) implementation and \u2026",

The second extension is the Extended Erlang Multirate Loss Model (E-EMLM), where an arriving call at a communication link requires certain bandwidth and, if not available, the call can reduce its bandwidth requirement while increasing (elastic traffic) or keeping unchanged (adaptive traffic) its service time requirement; this is done in accordance with the bandwidth reduction of the in-service calls. For the evaluation of the two models, we compare the call-level QoS index of Call Blocking Probability (CBP), when the average allocated link bandwidth is the same for the two models.

Calls follow a Poisson process, can tolerate bandwidth compression and have an exponentially distributed service time. When bandwidth compression occurs, the service time of new and in-service elastic calls increases. Adaptive calls do not alter their service time. All calls compete for the available link bandwidth under the combination of the Threshold (TH) and the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policies. The TH policy can provide different QoS among service-classes by limiting the number of calls of a service-class up to a predefined threshold, which can be different for each service-class. The BR policy reserves part of the available link bandwidth to benefit calls of high bandwidth requirements. The analysis of the proposed models is based on approximate but recursive formulas, whereby authors determine call blocking probabilities and link utilization. The accuracy of the proposed formulas is verified through simulation and found to be very satisfactory.",

First, we review an extension of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM), namely the Batched Poisson Erlang Multirate Loss Model (BP-EMLM), in which calls of each service arrive in a link of certain capacity, following a batch Poisson process and compete for the available link bandwidth under the Complete Sharing (CS) policy. The batch size is generally distributed while the partial batch blocking discipline is applied, ie depending on the available link bandwidth a part of an arriving batch can be accepted while the rest of it is discarded. Second, we propose the BP-EMLM under BR policy. The importance of this proposal is not only that we can guarantee specific call-level QoS for each service, but also that we strengthen the applicability of the BP-EMLM to overflow traffic modeling of alternate route systems, where BR policy must be applied in the overflow routes to protect direct traffic from overflow traffic. For the application of the BR policy in the BP-EMLM, we study two methods:(1) the Roberts and (2) the Stasiak\u2013Glabowski (S&G) method. The new model (with BR) does not have a product form solution and therefore we propose approximate but recursive formulas for the calculation of various performance measures,",

In a restricted accessibility system, call blocking occurs even if available resources do exist at the time of a call\u2019s arrival. In the two-link system under consideration, each link has two thresholds (offloading and support) which express the in-service calls in a link. The offloading threshold represents the point from which a link offloads calls. The support threshold (which is lower than the offloading threshold) defines the point up to which a link supports offloaded calls. The two-link system with restricted accessibility is modeled as a loss system whose steady state probabilities do not have a product form solution. However, approximate formulas for the determination of call blocking probabilities are proposed.

Calls of each service arrive to the link according to a batch Poisson process and compete for the available link bandwidth under the complete sharing policy. The batch size is generally distributed, while the batch blocking discipline is the partial batch blocking, ie depending on the available link bandwidth a part of an arriving batch is accepted while the rest of it is discarded. Accepted calls enter the system via state ON and can alternate between ON-OFF states. We prove that the proposed batched Poisson ON-OFF (BP-ON-OFF) model has a product form solution and provide an accurate recursive formula for the determination of various call-level performance measures such as the time and call congestion probabilities and link utilization.

In these networks, we distinguish two types of blocking, the new-call blocking, which concerns the initial call establishment request, and the handoffcall blocking, due to the users' mobility from one cell to the other. To analyze the system, we describe it by a Discrete Time Markov Chain, and based on it, we derive a recursive formula for the calculation of the state probabilities. Consequently, the new-call blocking probabilities and the handoffcall blocking probabilities are determined.

This call arrival process is known as a quasi-random process and is used in traffic modelling when the number of users who generate traffic is relatively small compared to the system capacity. In-service elastic and adaptive calls can tolerate bandwidth compression by extending their remaining servicetime (elastic calls) or not (adaptive calls). In this loss system, we study the effect of the bandwidth reservation policy on time congestion probabilities, call congestion probabilities and link utilization. The bandwidth reservation policy is considered when a certain quality of service for each service-class is required and is essential to be guaranteed. The proposed model does not have a product form solution, and therefore we propose approximate but recursive formulas for the efficient calculation of the above mentioned performance measures. The accuracy and consistency of the proposed model are verified by simulation and is found to be quite satisfactory. Finally, we generalize the proposed model to include calls from both finite and infinite number of traffic sources.",

The term \u201ccooperative\u201d refers to users that can retry (with a certain probability, when the total occupied bandwidth of the system is below a predefined threshold) to be connected in the system with a reduced bandwidth, if they are blocked with their initial peak-bandwidth requirement. This behavior increases the quality of service (QoS) perceived by other users. Due to the retries, the system model does not have a product form solution for the steady state distribution. However, we propose an efficient calculation of system\u2019s occupancy distribution, congestion probabilities and system\u2019s utilization, while avoiding complex state space enumeration and processing. As it is shown through simulation, the proposed recursive formulas are consistent and quite accurate. For evaluation, we use the conventional trunk/bandwidth reservation control to equalize the congestion probabilities and compare them with the results of the proposed models. Besides, we generalize the proposed models by considering the coexistence of random and quasi-random arrivals. Furthermore, we propose (a) a heuristic method for the determination of desired retry probabilities according to a fairness index and (b) an optimization procedure whereby we assess the retry threshold so that the QoS of the least speed non-cooperative calls is guaranteed for certain retry probabilities of cooperative calls.",

In this paper, we concentrate on the performance of a Dynamic Wavelength Allocation (DWA) protocol, under multi-dimensional traffic which is modeled by a Pareto ON-OFF model; it resembles the bursty nature of traffic by considering ON and OFF transmission periods, whose duration is Pareto distributed. The investigated protocol may cause service delay to existing connections, if they will be found in state OFF, while no connection is found in state ON at the same time. In this case, the occupied wavelength is released, and a new wavelength (however, not always available, hence the delay) will be allocated to OFF connections, upon request from a connection to return to state ON.

To design and develop appropriate defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the characteristics and the behavior of different types of ransomware. Dynamic analysis techniques are typically used to achieve that purpose, where the malicious binaries are executed in a controlled environment and are then observed. In this work, the dynamic analysis results focusing on the infamous WannaCry ransomware are presented. In particular, WannaCry is examined, during its execution in a purpose-built virtual lab environment, in order to analyze its infection, persistence, recovery prevention and propagation mechanisms. The results obtained may be used for developing appropriate detection and defense solutions for WannaCry and other ransomware families that exhibit similar behaviors.",

If there is no available bandwidth in the link, a call is blocked but retries with a lower bandwidth requirement at the cost of an increased service time. To allow for the fact that a blocked call may leave the link due to impatience, we consider the case that a blocked call retries with a probability. To determine call blocking probabilities, we prove an approximate but recursive formula which provides quite satisfactory results compared to simulation.",

This is achieved by decoupling the decision-making process from the underlying network infrastructure that forwards the traffic. Recently, there have been efforts in applying the SDN approach to wireless and cellular networks. In fact, SDN is considered as one of the key enablers for future 5G communication networks. Information-centric networking (ICN) is another emerging communication paradigm that has been proposed to improve the content delivery efficiency compared to the traditional host-centric communication protocols. ICN decouples the data from their location, application, and means of transportation. This feature makes ICN particularly suitable for efficient dissemination of large volumes of data, especially in highly dynamic and heterogeneous mobile environments. In \u2026",

Since the considered convergence seems to be dominant, it deserves assiduous analysis and evaluation. In this study, the authors investigate the delay performance of a converged optical-wireless network that provides QoS support by considering multiple service-classes with different priorities.

When a new call cannot be accepted in the system with its peak-bandwidth requirement, it can retry one or more times (single and multiretry loss model, respectively) to be connected in the system with reduced bandwidth requirement and increased service time, exponentially distributed. Furthermore, if its last bandwidth requirement is still higher than the available link bandwidth, it can be accepted in the system by compressing not only the bandwidth of all in-service calls (of all service-classes) but also its last bandwidth requirement. The proposed model does not have a product form solution and therefore we propose an approximate recursive formula for the calculation of the link occupancy distribution and consequently call blocking probabilities. The accuracy of the proposed formula is verified by simulation and is found to be quite satisfactory.",

            "Abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a novel networking approach that aims at overcoming some of the limitations of the current Internet. In particular, NDN aims at providing better privacy and security by focusing on the data items themselves rather than on the location of data. This is achieved by using soft states at the routers, which record the requests/interests for data from users in the Pending Interest Table (PIT). However, this new networking concept opens up avenues for launching Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on PITs. That is, an attacker may flood the network with a large number of Interest packets that would overflow the PITs at the routers, thus preventing legitimate users from receiving the requested data. This type of DDoS attack is known as the Interest Flooding Attack (IFA) and, if not adequately dealt with, may severely disrupt the normal operation of an NDN system. In this paper, we first show that the basic NDN mechanism is vulnerable to IFA even when the attacker has very limited resources. Next, we propose a mitigation technique that allows routers to quickly identify and block such DDoS attempts, by detecting anomalous user behaviour. We also introduce an additional security layer by using public-key based router authentication. We evaluate our proposed scheme by means of computer simulations and show that a sufficient level of security can be achieved with little processing and storage overhead.",

This assessment is important for the bandwidth allocation among serviceclasses, the avoidance of too costly over-dimensioning of the network and the prevention, through traffic engineering mechanisms, of excessive throughput degradation. Despite of its importance, the call-level QoS evaluation remains an open issue, due to the presence of elastic traffic in modern telecom networks.In this paper we consider elastic traffic in connectionoriented networks at call level, ie a) calls which have contingency alternative bandwidth requirements at the call setup phase and b) the ability of in-service calls to reduce their bandwidth (elastic bandwidth), while increasing simultaneously their service time. According to the call arrival process, the bandwidth requirements of calls and their behavior during their lifetime, we distinguish the study of multi-service loss models into four categories: A: Random arriving calls with either fixed or elastic bandwidth requirements, and constant use of their assigned bandwidth (constant-bit-rate) during their lifetime. B: Random arriving calls with either fixed or elastic bandwidth requirements, and elastic bandwidth during their lifetime.",

For single links, the proposed models are based on Markov chains and well-established teletraffic models, while, for mesh all-optical networks, they are also based on a reduced load approximation method (RLA).

A key feature of ICN is the support for in-network content caching. In this paper, we present a new cache-aware routing scheme for ICN. Our scheme takes into account the information about the locations of caches in the network and constructs delivery paths for efficient content dissemination. The proposed approach does not impose additional signaling overhead in the network; while at the same time it is agnostic of the cached contents. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation studies, which show an up to 50% delay reduction compared to traditional routing approaches.",

Calls of each serviceclass compete for the available link bandwidth under the complete sharing policy. The batch blocking discipline is the partial batch blocking, ie depending on the available bandwidth a part of the batch (one or more calls) is accepted. Accepted calls enter the system via state ON and can alternate between ON-OFF states. When a call is transferred to state OFF it releases its bandwidth in state ON, which becomes available to other calls. We show that the proposed batched Poisson ON-OFF (BP-ON-OFF) model has a product form solution and provide an accurate recursive formula for the determination of various call-level performance measures such as the time and call congestion probabilities. Furthermore we show the relation between the BP-ON-OFF model and other multirate loss models that exist in the literature.",

In this paper we investigate the performance of a simple PON configuration, in respect of the end-to-end packet delay. The network supports multiple service-classes with priorities, in terms of the number of packets that can be transmitted in each transmission period. We calculate the mean queueing delay of a packet, by taking into account the fact that packets are serviced in batches. The queueing delay is defined through the formulation of two queuing models; an M/D/1 model for the batches, and an M/D/m model for the individual packets. We also study the effect of the packet arrival rate of different service-classes, and the effect of the distribution of the packets into a frame, on the end-to-end packet delay. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by simulation and was found to \u2026",

Calls of each service arrive to the link according to a Poisson process and compete for its available bandwidth under the complete sharing policy. Blocked calls may retry one or more times to enter the system, with reduced bandwidth and increased mean service time requirements. An accepted call may alternate between states ON and OFF or remain always in state ON. Calls enter the system only via state ON. When a call is transferred to state OFF it releases the bandwidth holding in state ON which becomes available for new arriving calls. The new model does not have a product form solution and therefore the CBP calculation is based on approximate recursive formulas, proposed in this paper. Simulation results validate our analytical methodology.",

In a restricted accessibility system, a new call may be blocked even if available bandwidth units do exist at the time of its arrival. In the two-link system, each particular link has a low and a high threshold. Both thresholds express the number of in-service calls in the link. The low threshold shows the point up to which the link can support offloaded calls from the other link. The high threshold shows the point where one link starts offloading calls to the other link. The two-link system with restricted accessibility is modelled as a loss model whose steady state probabilities do not have a product form solution.

            "Abstract": "The smart grid (SG), generally referred to as the next-generation power system, is considered as a revolutionary and evolutionary regime of existing power grids. Among the emerging SG applications, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enables automated, two-way communication between a smart meter (SM) and a public utility company. To authenticate a message, the sender (e.g., a SM) signs the message with its private key using a pre-defined digital signature algorithm. To verify the message, the recipient verifies the sender's certificate and then the sender's signature using the sender's public key. In some cases, however, a previously issued certificate for a network node needs to be revoked. In this paper we investigate two possible approaches for the certificate management of SMs in AMI networks. These are based on the traditional certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and on the Bloom filters. We compare the two approaches in terms of the required packet size for the distribution of the revoked certificate serial numbers. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach.",

A new call is accepted in the system with its peak-bandwidth requirement if there is available link bandwidth. If not, the call retries one or more times (single and multi-retry loss model, respectively) to be accepted in the link with reduced bandwidth. If the available link bandwidth is lower than the call\u2019s last bandwidth requirement, the call can still try to be connected in the link by compressing its last bandwidth requirement (down to a certain bandwidth) together with the bandwidth of all in-service calls.

In such networks, the distinction between the new and the handoff traffic is very important. A simple CAC scheme can distinguish the calls between the two traffic types by setting different thresholds for call admission. This simple CAC scheme is evaluated in respect of blocking probabilities of both new and handoff calls. To this end, we formulate an aggregate Markov chain, which describes both the new-call and handoff-call arrival processes, under the assumption that they are both Poisson processes. Based on this Markov chain we derive recurrent and computationally efficient formulas for the calculation of the system state probabilities. Consequently, we calculate the new-call and handoff-call blocking probabilities. The analytical results are verified through simulation \u2026",

Calls of all service\u2010classes arrive in the link according to a batched Poisson process. The batched Poisson process is important not only because in several applications calls arrive as batches (groups), but also because it can represent, in an approximate way, arrival processes that are more \"peaked\" and \"bursty\" (expressed by the peakedness factor z) than the Poisson process.

Nowadays, passive optical networks are the most promising and costeffective class of fiber access systems. This rapid evolvement of fiber in access networks motivates the study of their performance. In this paper we develop teletraffic loss models for calculating connection failure probabilities (due to unavailability of a wavelength) and call blocking probabilities (due to the restricted bandwidth capacity of a wavelength) in hybrid TDM-WDM passive optical networks with dynamic wavelength allocation. The springboard of our analysis is well-established teletraffic models. The proposed models are derived from one-dimensional Markov chains which describe the wavelength\u2019s occupancy in the optical access network. The optical access network accommodates multiple service-classes with infinite or finite number of traffic-sources.

It promises innovative business models and improved user experience. However, as evidenced by recent attacks such as the Mirai botnet, IoT networks and systems remain very vulnerable and require stronger protection mechanisms. Furthermore, due to processing, memory, and power constraints of typical IoT devices, traditional Internet security mechanisms are not always feasible or appropriate. In this work, we are concerned with designing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for protecting IoT networks from external threats as well as internal compromised devices. Our proposed design adopts a signature-based intrusion detection approach and involves both certralised and distributed IDS modules. Using the Cooja simulator, we have implemented a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario on IoT devices. This scenario exploits the RPL protocol, which is widely used for routing in low-power networks, including IoT networks. In particular, we have implemented two variants of DoS attacks, namely \u201cHello\u201d flooding and version number modification. As shown by simulation results, these attacks may impact the reachability of certain IoT devices and their power consumption.",

The lowest threshold, named support threshold, defines up to which point the link can support calls offloaded from the other link. The highest threshold, named offloading threshold, defines the point where the link starts offloading calls to the other link. The two-link system with restricted accessibility is modelled as a loss model whose steady state probabilities do not have a product form solution. However, we propose approximate formulas for the calculation of call blocking \u2026",

            "Abstract": "We consider a two-link system with restricted accessibility that accommodates Poisson arriving calls from different service-classes and propose a multirate teletraffic loss model for its analysis. In a restricted accessibility system, a new call may be blocked even if available bandwidth units do exist at the time of its arrival. In the two-link system, each particular link has two thresholds which refer to the number of inservice calls in the link. The lowest threshold, named support threshold, defines up to which point the link can support calls offloaded from the other link. The highest threshold, named offloading threshold, defines the point where the link starts offloading calls to the other link. The two-link system with restricted accessibility is modelled as a loss model whose steady state probabilities do not have a product form solution. However, we propose approximate formulas for the calculation of call blocking probabilities. The accuracy of the formulas is verified through simulation and found to be quite satisfactory.",
