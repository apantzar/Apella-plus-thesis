Artificial intelligence can provide efficient tools for most environmental problems of monitoring, analysis, interpretation, forecasting, management, and control. The development of interdisciplinary research groups between specialists from environmental sciences and artificial intelligence can lead to new ideas and innovative applications in the area of environmental protection systems. We hope that AIAEP’2009 will be a good opportunity for the researchers to exchange ideas and to initiate new collaborations in this interdiciplinary area, as both, Artificial intelligence and Environmental protection are domains of strategic interest.For this first edition, we received 12 papers and after a reviewing process, 9 papers were selected based on the judgement of two referees from the organising committee. The technical issues addressed by the selected papers for this workshop come from all environmental fields: water resources management, environmental accounting, wastewater treatment, maritime pollution, oil spill pollution, soil erosion risk assessment, air pollution dispersion assessment, detection and classification of waste on irregular terrains, residential fire detection, biological foaming in anaerobic digestion simulation and estimation of permeability of granular soil.",1
PROMAISE: A Knowledge-based System for Software Project Management Antipattern Using Semantic Web Technologies (technical report),2009,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8429261461887163273&hl=en&oi=scholarr,"A successful way of solving newly encountered problems is by subconsciously applying a solution that has been previously applied successfully to a similar problem [1]. This approach requires experience through successes and failures and expertise in order to identify such problem and solution pairs and then document them as patterns [2]. In software engineering, design patterns describe a recurring problem and its solution. Design patterns can reduce development time by providing proven development paradigms [3]. By documenting design patterns, software developers and architects can reuse design patterns in order to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems. The usefulness of studying the successful ways of solving problems has been well proved in software engineering by the valuable concept of design patterns. However, design patterns focus on coding and architectural issues and can not …",0
Querying and Visualizing the Semantic Web,2006,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Efstratios-Kontopoulos/publication/228945814_Querying_and_Visualizing_the_Semantic_Web/links/54f352ec0cf299c8d9e509b0/Querying-and-Visualizing-the-Semantic-Web.pdf,"The Semantic Web (SW)[1] constitutes an effort to improve the current Web, by targeting at the meaning rather than the presentation of information. This way the content of the Web is made accessible not only to humans, as it is today, but to machines/agents as well, with the latter being now able to understand the available information on the Web and act on behalf of users, in order to achieve their goals in an automated and accurate way.To describe information appropriately, knowledge representation languages based on XML have been proposed, such as RDF [2] and OWL [3]. Both languages are used to annotate the information in a formal and explicit way by defining ontologies, using classes, properties and instances of classes. The difference between the two languages is the degree of expressiveness they offer. Thus, while RDF is capable of defining only subclass and subproperty relationships between classes and properties respectively, OWL goes a step further by offering a higher degree of expressiveness. Having been built on top of RDF, OWL introduces more relationships between classes, properties and instances, allowing the use of property constraints and Boolean operators (union, intersection, etc) in class definitions.",1

In addition, the design of such e-commerce sites is strongly influenced by retailers whose only goal is to sell as many products as possible to the users that visit their site. As a result, such sites follow a fixed representation for the products offered and put more emphasis on the price, less emphasis on the complete presentation of the features of the product, and unfortunately, they discourage side-by-side comparison shopping. Moreover, presenting various products, they put emphasis on just a few strong features and they don’t mention the weak ones. Although such e-shops are valuable for the final purchase transaction, they fail to service the non-informed customer, that is, the potential buyer that has no clear picture of what exactly to buy from the available …",0

DR-DEVICE: A Defeasible Logic RDF Rule Language,2004,https://www.academia.edu/download/37730134/iswc04-demo.pdf,"Defeasible reasoning is a rule4based approach for efficient reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. Such reasoning is, among others, useful for ontology integration, where conflicting information arises naturally; and for the modeling of business rules and policies, where rules with exceptions are often used. In this demonstration we pre4 sent a prototype system for defeasible reasoning on the Web. The system is called DR4DEVICE [4] and is capable of reasoning about RDF metadata over multiple Web sources using defeasible logic [1] rules. The system is implemented on top of CLIPS production rule system and builds upon R4DEVICE [5], an earlier deductive rule system over RDF metadata that also supports derived attribute and aggregate attribute rules. Rules can be expressed either in a native CLIPS4like language, or in an extension of the OO4RuleML [9] syntax. The operational semantics of defeasible logic are implemented through compilation into the generic rule language of R4DEVICE. This demonstration includes a complete use case of a semantic web broker that reasons about apartment renting. The most important features of DR4DEVICE are the following:• Support for multiple rule types of defeasible logic, such as strict rules, defeasible rules, and defeaters.• Support for both classical (strong) negation and negation-as-failure.• Support for conflicting literals, ie derived objects that exclude each other.• Direct import from the Web of RDF ontologies and data as input facts to the defeasible logic program.• Direct import from the Web of defeasible logic programs in an XML compliant rule syntax (RuleML).• Direct export to …",0

Causal Knowledge Extraction from Online Repositories,0,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5873636276014150904&hl=en&oi=scholarr,"Infusing autonomous artificial systems with causal knowledge about the physical world they inhabit is of utmost importance and a long-lasting goal in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Training systems with relevant data is a common approach; yet, it is not always feasible to find the data needed, especially since a big part of this knowledge is commonsense. Therefore, many studies try to exploit alternative means of acquiring causal knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for extracting causal relations about objects, actions and states from online repositories, such as ConceptNet and WordNet. We present a complete cycle of locating, storing, enriching, evaluating, cleaning and exposing causal knowledge from such resources, taking into consideration semantic similarity measures, as well as other metrics, while processing the data.

Applying neural networks with active neurons to sea-water quality measurements,2005,https://www.academia.edu/download/37730122/hatzikos_et_al_1.pdf,"This study examines the presence of either linear or nonlinear relationships between a number of popular sea-water quality indicators such as water temperature, pH, amount of dissolved oxygen and turbidity. The data are obtained from a set of sensors in an underwater measurement station. The neural networks with active neurons are applied to the prediction of each one of the above four indicators and their performance is compared against a benchmark prediction method known as the random walk model. The random walk model is the simpler prediction method, which accepts as the best prediction for a variable its current value. The neural network with active neurons is a black box method, which contrary to neural networks with passive neurons does not require a long set of training data. The results show that for daily predictions the neural network with active neurons is able to beat the random walk model with regard to directional accuracy, namely the direction (upward or downwards) of the modelling object in the next day.",1
Modeling human daily preferences through a context-aware web-mapping system using semantic technologies,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574119216301286,"In this paper, a novel geosocial networking service called “G-SPLIS” (Geosocial Semantic Personalized Location Information System) is presented. The paper provides a methodology to design, implement and share in a formal way human daily preferences regarding points of interest (POIs) and POI owners’ group targeted offering policies, via user-defined preferences and policy rules. By adding rules at run time users have more flexibility and they do not rely on the pre-determined application’s methods to get personalized information. Furthermore, G-SPLIS provides a large knowledge base for other systems in the web, because rules are easily sharable. To achieve the above, the presented system is compatible with Semantic Web standards such as the schema.org ontology and uses RuleML for rules that define regular users’ preferences and POI owner’s group-targeted offers. Finally, it combines at run-time the …",0
Real-Time Investors’ Sentiment Analysis from Newspaper Articles,2017,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46200-4_1,"Recently, investor sentiment measures have become one of the more widely examined areas in behavioral finance.

An economic useful proxy for investor sentiment is constructed from U.S. news articles mainly provided by The New York Times. Initially, a large amount of articles for ten big companies and indices is collected and processed, in order to be able to extract a sentiment score from each one of them. Then, the classifier is trained from the positive, negative and neutral articles, so that it is possible afterwards to examine the sentiment of any unseen newspaper article, for any company or …",0
Evlib: A library for the management of the electric vehicles in the smart grid,2016,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2903220.2903225,"EVLib is a Java library for the management and simulation of a number of Electric Vehicle (EV) activities, at a charging station level, within a Smart Grid environment. EVLib aims to solve interoperability issues between a number of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related techniques already applied in this field. Thus, it provides a simple, yet efficient interface for the management of all major EV-related activities such as the charging and dis-charging of batteries, as well as the battery swapping. Moreover, a large number of parameters, such as the number of chargers, the waiting queues, and the available energy can be easily configured. On top of this, the library supports the simultaneous operation of many EV activities through the efficient use of threads.

Towards an agent-based negotiation scheme for scheduling electric vehicles charging,2015,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33509-4_14,"We consider the problem of scheduling Electric Vehicle (EV) charging within a single charging station aiming to maximize the number of charged EVs, as well as the amount of charged energy. In so doing, we propose one offline optimal solution using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) techniques, and two online solutions which incrementally execute the MIP algorithm each time an EV arrives at the charging station. Moreover, we apply agent based negotiation techniques between the station and the EVs in order to service EVs when the MIP problem is initially unsolvable due to insufficient resources (i.e., requested energy, charging time window). We evaluate our solutions in a setting partially using real data, and we show that when applying negotiation techniques, the number of EVs charged increases on average by , energy utilization by , while there is only a small deficit (about ) on average …",0
PLIS+: A Rule-Based Personalized Location Information System.,2012,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.416.6960&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"In this paper, the idea of providing personalized, location-based information services via rule-based policies is demonstrated. After a short introduction, an innovative Personalized Location Information System (PLIS+) is designed and implemented. PLIS+ delivers personalized and contextualized information to users according to rule-based policies. More specifically, many categories of points of interest (for example shops, restaurants) have rule-based policies to expose and deploy their marketing strategy on special offers, discounts, etc. PLIS+ evaluates these rules on-the-fly and delivers personalized information according to the user’s context and the corresponding rules fired within this context. After discussing the design and the implementation of PLIS+, illustrative examples of PLIS+ functionality are presented. As a result, PLIS+ proves that combining contextual data and rules can lead to powerful personalized information services.",1

Towards online electric vehicle scheduling for mobility-on-demand schemes,2018,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14174-5_7,"We study a setting where electric vehicles (EVs) can be hired to drive from pick-up to drop-off stations in a mobility-on-demand (MoD) scheme. Each point in the MoD scheme is equipped with battery charge facility to cope with the EVs’ limited range. Customer-agents announce their trip requests over time, and the goal for the system is to maximize the number of them that are serviced. In this vein, we propose two scheduling algorithms for assigning EVs to agents. The first one is efficient for short term reservations, while the second for both short and long term ones. While evaluating our algorithms in a setting using real data on MoD locations, we observe that the long term algorithm achieves on average 2.08% higher customer satisfaction and 2.87% higher vehicle utilization compared to the short term one for 120 trip requests, but with 17.8% higher execution time. Moreover, we propose a software package …",0
A rule-based eCommerce methodology for the IoT using trustworthy Intelligent Agents and Microservices,2018,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99906-7_22,"The impact of the Internet of Things will transform business and economy.

PRACTIC means PaRallel ACTIve Classes and is based on the vertical partitioning and concurrent management of the database schema classes and metaclasses, which are collectively called active objects. Active objects are permanent processes in memory that encapsulate their definitions, methods, and management procedures. Semiactive and passive objects exist to realize abstract classes and instances (the actual data), respectively. The object model gives rise to a query/method execution model that provides parallelism on all levels of the instantiation hierarchy. The abstract PRACTIC machine directly maps the model to a MIMD machine. The performance of one of the proposed parallel query/method execution schemes is measured by simulation on the abstract machine.",1
PaaSport semantic model: An ontology for a platform-as-a-service semantically interoperable marketplace,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X17300551,"PaaS is a Cloud computing service that provides a computing platform to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of infrastructure maintenance. SMEs are reluctant to enter the growing PaaS market due to the possibility of being locked in to a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport Marketplace aims to avoid the provider lock-in problem by allowing Platform provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings and Software SMEs to deploy or migrate their applications on the best-matching offering, through a thin, non-intrusive Cloud broker. In this paper, we present the PaaSport semantic model, namely an OWL ontology, extension of the DUL ontology. The ontology is used for semantically representing (a) PaaS offering capabilities and (b) requirements of applications to be deployed. The ontology has been designed to optimally support a semantic …",0
Intelligent Querying of Web Documents Using a Deductive XML Repository,2002,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46014-4_39,"In this paper, we present a deductive object-oriented database system, called X-DEVICE, which is used as a repository for XML documents. X-DEVICE employs a powerful rule-based query language for intelligently querying stored Web documents and data and publishing the results. XML documents are stored into the OODB by automatically mapping the DTD to an object schema. XML elements are treated either as objects or attributes based on their complexity, without loosing the relative order of elements in the original document. The rule-based language features second-order logic syntax, generalized path and ordering expressions, which greatly facilitate the querying of recursive, treestructured XML data and the construction of XML trees as query results. All the extended features of the rule language are translated through the use of object metadata into a set of first-order deductive rules that are …",0
Constraint checking in a parallel object-oriented database system,1995,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10637199508915480,"This paper deals with parallel checking of passive constraints in object-oriented databases. It presents a parallel algorithm for constraint checking based on a master-slave technique and discusses its implementation on a parallel object-oriented database system. The system is named PRACTIC and is based on class concurrency. Passive constraints, unlike active database rules, are independent and can be executed using AND-parallelism. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm offers considerable speedup, which mainly depends on the number of constraints and the total constraint execution time, while it is only slightly affected from the distribution of constraints and the constraint scheduling policy. Finally, it is explained how the PRACTIC system enhances the algorithm's performance using features, like nested query parallelism and constraint overlapping.",1
Mechanism design for efficient allocation of electric vehicles to charging stations,2020,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411408.3411434,"The electrification of transport can significantly reduce CO2 emissions and their negative impact on the environment. In this paper, we study the problem of allocating Electric Vehicles (EVs) to charging stations and scheduling their charging. We develop an offline solution that treats EV users as self-interested agents that aim to maximise their profit and minimise the impact on their schedule. We formulate the problem of the optimal EV to charging station allocation as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) one and we propose two pricing mechanisms: A fixed-price one, and another that is based on the well known Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) mechanism. We observe that the VCG mechanism services on average 1.5% more EVs than the fixed-price one. In addition, when the stations get congested, VCG leads to higher prices for the EVs and higher profit for the stations, but lower utility for the EVs. However, the VCG …",0
SWRL2SPIN: Converting SWRL to SPIN.,2018,https://easychair-www.easychair.org/publications/preprint_download/mKRN,"SWRL is a semantic web rule language that combines OWL ontologies with Horn Logic rules of the RuleML family of rule languages. Being supported by Protégé as well as by popular rule engines and ontology reasoners, such as Jess, Drools and Pellet, SWRL has become a very popular choice for developing rule-based applications on top of ontologies. However, being doubtful whether SWRL will become a W3C standard, it is difficult to reach out to the industrial world. On the other hand, SPIN has become a de-facto industry standard to represent SPARQL rules and constraints on Semantic Web models, building on the widespread acceptance of the SPARQL query language. In this paper, we argue that the life of existing SWRL rule-based ontology applications can be prolonged by being transformed into SPIN. To this end, we have developed a prototype tool using SWI-Prolog that takes as input an OWL ontology with a SWRL rule base and transforms SWRL rules into SPIN rules in the same ontology, taking into consideration the object-oriented scent of SPIN, ie linking rules to the appropriate ontology classes as derived by analyzing the rule conditions.",1

Visual stratification of defeasible logic rule bases,2007,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4410386/,"Logic and proofs constitute key factors in increasing the user trust towards the semantic Web. Defeasible reasoning is a useful tool towards the development of the logic layer of the semantic Web architecture. However, having a solid mathematical notation, it may be confusing to end users, who often need graphical trace and explanation mechanisms for the derived conclusions. In a previous work of ours, we outlined a methodology for representing defeasible logic rules, utilizing directed graphs that feature distinct node and connection types. However, visualizing a defeasible logic rule base also involves the placement of the multiple graph elements in an intuitive way, a non-trivial task that aims at improving user comprehensibility.

Visual Representation of web service composition problems through VLEPpO,2007,http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-302/paper6.pdf,"This paper discusses the problem of the automatic composition of Semantic Web Services. Web Services constitute a new computing paradigm, which provides a standardized framework that facilitates the interoperability among software systems and machines that are accessible through the Internet. Semantics can significantly improve software reuse and discovery and allow the automatic composition of Web Services in order to produce large scale applications. The use of VLEPpO for the automatic composition of Web Services is proposed. VLEPpO is a visual programming tool for designing planning problems using visual elements and simple mouse operations. In the tool the user simply defines the properties of the available Web Services and the global goals of the application. Then VLEPpO automatically forms the description as a planning problem, solves it by calling an appropriate planning system and exports the solution either to a Web Service execution monitoring system or to a UDDI registry.",1
Modeling Information Extraction Wrappers with Conceptual Graphs,2004,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1062.9019&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"In this paper, we propose the use of the Conceptual Graphs knowledge representation and reasoning formalism to model information extraction wrappers (CG-Wrappers). An information extraction wrapper is a mapping that populates a data repository with implicit objects that exist inside a given web page. Creating a wrapper, usually involves some training by which the wrapper learns to identify the desired information based, mainly, on the surrounding HTML elements. In the paper, we demonstrate how the generalization, specialization and projection operations of the Conceptual Graph theory, naturally support semi-automatic wrapper induction and wrapper evaluation. The proposed modeling approach is flexible enough to support wrapper reuse, enabling us in that way to create more complex wrappers.",1

The knowledge of the rule system has been acquired through a rule induction algorithm. Specifically, the approach of propositional rule learning was applied to a dataset produced by results from experiments on a large number of problems from various domains, including those used in the three International Planning Competitions.

New systems appeared that are able to cope with planning problems being orders of magnitude more complex than the ones solvable in early 90's. This vast improvement increase was made possible mainly by three new approaches in plan generation: planning graphs, satisfiability planning and heuristic state-space planning. The latter approach, which is the most powerful one, derives a heuristic function from the specification of a planning problem, independently of its domain, and uses it for guiding the search through the space of the states. During the last years appeared many heuristic state-space planners, such as ASP, HSP, GRT and FF, which were able to solve large transportation logistics problems, with numerous locations, trucks and objects that have to be transferred, very efficiently, as it has been shown in the recent international planning competitions.This paper briefly presents the current status in domain-independent heuristic state-space planning and concentrates on the GRT and MO-GRT planners, where the latter is a recent extension of GRT being able to consider multiple criteria in the plan generation and evaluation process.

Towards multipolicy argumentation,2018,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3200947.3201032,"In this paper, we develop a novel computational argumentation framework for resolving conflicts that arise in a community of multiple stakeholders where each one of them bears a private policy/strategy for shared and inter-related decisions. Decisions taken individually by stakeholders can be contradicting, so there is a need for an arbitration service that will resolve the conflict and conclude on a single decision. Centralized mediation approaches gather all relevant context information and decide on the prevailing decision option as suggested individually by multiple stakeholders. There is high complexity on resolving all possible competing option conflicts among all competing stakeholders, thus, usually centralized solutions do not scale. Our approach avoids this complexity because it is based on defining an arbitration meta-policy for deciding on the priorities among stakeholders, which are few, and not among …",0

A web service reasoner for the semantic web,2007,https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/seerc-final.pdf,"The advent of Web Services is a proof that nowadays the need for communication among loosely coupled distributed systems is bigger than ever. Web Services offer a well-defined interface, through which other programs may interact, by sending messages based on Internet protocols and Web standards. They may also be combined, in order to achieve a complex service, whose functionality cannot be achieved by a single one, a procedure that is called service composition. The description of a service interface is based on the Web Service Description Language (WSDL [14]) that describes the syntax of the input and output messages using XML, as well as other details needed for the invocation of the service. The communication is based on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP [12]), an XML-based framework that provides a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols.The vision of the Semantic Web is to provide the necessary standards and infrastructure for transforming the Web into a more automatic environment, where software agents would have the ability to search for requested information automatically. This is feasible by describing appropriately the already available data on the Web in a machine-understandable way. Ontologies can be considered as a key towards this goal since they provide a controlled vocabulary of concepts, each with an explicitly defined and machine processable semantics.",1

An intelligent educational metadata repository,2003,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1033.5125&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"Recently, several standardization efforts for e-learning technologies gave rise to various specifications for educational metadata, that is, data describing all the"" entities"" involved in an educational procedure. The internal details of systems that utilize these metadata are still an open issue since these efforts are primarily dealing with"" what"" and not"" how"". In this chapter, under the light of these emerging standardization efforts, we present XDevice, an intelligent XML repository system for educational metadata. XDevice can be used as the intelligent back-end of a WWW portal on which"" learning objects"" are supplied by educational service providers and accessed by learners according to their individual profiles and educational needs. XDevice transforms the widely adopted XML binding for educational metadata into a flexible, object-oriented representation and uses intelligent second-order logic querying facilities to provide advanced, personalized functionality. Furthermore, a case study is presented, in which learning object metadata and learner's profile metadata are combined under certain XDevice rules in order to dynamically infer customized courses for the learner.",1
Constraint maintenance using generated methods in the P/FDM object-oriented database,1994,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-3225-7_22,"We discuss the use of code-generated methods in Prolog as a flexible and efficient way to implement complex semantic constraints in an OODB. We introduce a high-level constraint language CoLan, based on functions and sets and including range quantifiers, from which fragments of code are generated to check the constraints. These fragments are attached to slots in class descriptors, and are also inherited (constraints cannot be overridden). Thus many fragments can come from one constraint and one slot may have attached fragments from many constraints. Constraints can be selectively disabled or removed which causes inhibition or disabling of corresponding fragments. This overcomes many objections to implementing constraints through methods. We have prototyped it by using the metaclass facilities of ADAM to initiate code generation. We are now re-implementing it in P/FDM, using changes to …",0
StoRM: A social agent-based trust model for the internet of things adopting microservice architecture,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X19300322,"Over the last years, the Internet of Things attracted much attention mainly due to its potential to change our daily life. It attempts to create a world where everyone and everything will be connected while knowledge will be diffused effortlessly. Yet, this open, distributed and heterogeneous environment raises important challenges, such as intelligence and trustworthiness. Intelligent Agents can deal with these challenges since they form an alternative to traditional interactions among people and objects while, at the same time, they are involved in a rich research effort regarding trust management. Additionally, intelligent agents seem able to deal with potential societal impacts and relationships, although they are not primary social networks, as well as the heterogeneity in the Internet of Things when combined with novel approaches such as the microservice architecture. To this end, this article proposes a novel …",0
Trusted reasoning services for semantic web agents,2010,http://informatica.si/index.php/informatica/article/viewFile/317/316,"The Semantic Web aims at enriching information with well-defined semantics, making it possible both for people and machines to understand Web content. Intelligent agents are the most prominent approach towards realizing this vision. Nevertheless, agents do not necessarily share a common rule or logic formalism, neither would it be realistic to attempt imposing specific logic formalisms in a rapidly changing world like the Web. Thus, based on the plethora of proposals and standards for logic-and rule-based reasoning for the Semantic Web, a key factor for the success of Semantic Web agents lies in the interoperability of reasoning tasks. This paper reports on the implementation of trusted, third party reasoning services wrapped as agents in a multi-agent system framework. This way, agents can exchange their arguments, without the need to conform to a common rule or logic paradigm–via an external reasoning service, the receiving agent can grasp the semantics of the received rule set. Finally, a use case scenario is presented that illustrates the viability of the proposed approach. Povzetek: Semantični spletni agenti potrebujejo oceno zaupanja storitev za kvalitetno delovanje.",1
Capturing RDF Descriptive Semantics in an Object Oriented Knowledge Base System.,2003,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nick-Bassiliades/publication/221024133_Capturing_RDF_Descriptive_Semantics_in_an_Object_Oriented_Knowledge_Base_System/links/0046352616e949e8b4000000/Capturing-RDF-Descriptive-Semantics-in-an-Object-Oriented-Knowledge-Base-System.pdf,"In this paper, we present a deductive object-oriented knowledge base system, called R-DEVICE, which imports RDF data into the CLIPS production rule system as objects and uses a deductive rule language for querying and reasoning about them. In our model properties of resources are not scattered across several triples as in most other RDF storage and querying systems, resulting in increased query per-formance due to less joins. R-DEVICE features a powerful deductive rule language which is able to express arbitrary queries both on the RDF schema and data, including generalized path expressions, strati-fied negation, aggregate, grouping, and sorting, functions, mainly due to the second-order syntax of the rule language which is efficiently translated into sets of first-order logic rules using metadata.",1
A multi-agent coordination framework for smart building energy management,2014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6974838/,"This paper presents a novel energy management framework for multi-agent coordination in smart buildings. The framework builds on top of an existing Service-Oriented middleware for Ambient Intelligence, which offers sensor and actuator functions of wireless devices. The middleware also provides a semantics infrastructure that assists in authoring agent policies for reducing energy consumption and maximizing user comfort. Each agent within the framework is responsible for monitoring the environmental context and controlling the electrical appliances of a specific room. However, the collective behavior of the multi-agent system is controlled by a Coordinator Agent that approves or rejects the allocation of building resources in time, aiming at more ""long-term"" goals that are out of the reach and scope of the individual Room Agents. The agents' underlying logic is expressed via defeasible logics, a formalism …",0

We motivate and explain the approach we propose, and report on a prototypical implementation exhibiting the described functionality in a multi-agent environment.",1
A knowledge-based framework for building web service domains,2003,https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pci9-bassiliades.pdf,"This paper describes a knowledge-based framework, called SWIM, for building Web Service Domains, which are collections or communities of related Web Services that are mediated and/or aggregated by a single Web Service, called the Mediator Service that functions as a proxy for them. When a requestor sends a message to the Mediator Service our system will select one or more of the Web Services to dispatch the message and will fuse the results returned by the selected services. The selection of Web services and the algorithm for fusing the results is defined by the administrator of the Service Domain using a declarative rule language, called X-DEVICE. SWIM system offers services for registering new Web Services and Service Domains. The main advantage of the SWIM system, compared to similar proposed approaches is that it allows the easy definition of arbitrary service selection strategies using a logicbased language. Furthermore, it goes beyond the mere conditional re-routing of Web Service requests by allowing combination of results of multiple Web Services leading to a simple logic-based form for Web Service composition.",1

Object-Action Association Extraction from Knowledge Graphs,2021,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/57419,"Infusing autonomous artificial systems with knowledge about the physical world they inhabit is of utmost importance and a long-lasting goal in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Training systems with relevant data is a common approach; yet, it is not always feasible to find the data needed, especially since a big portion of this knowledge is commonsense. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting and evaluating relations between objects and actions from knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet and WordNet. We present a complete methodology of locating, enriching, evaluating, cleaning and exposing knowledge from such resources, taking into consideration semantic similarity methods. One important aspect of our method is the flexibility in deciding how to deal with the noise that exists in the data. We compare our method with typical approaches found in the relevant literature, such as methods that …",0
An Open-Ended Web Knowledge Retrieval Framework with Explanation and Learning through Argumentation,2021,http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj2796.pdf,"Semantic Web knowledge bases can provide explainability and knowledge availability to the knowledge representation of any cognitive robotic system. For this reason, we present a knowledge retrieval framework enhanced with external knowledge sources that can argue about its decisions and even learn new knowledge through an argumentation dialogue. The framework provides commonsense knowledge about sequences of actions on how to perform human scaled tasks in a household environment, answers queries about household objects, and performs semantic matching between entities from the web knowledge graphs DBpedia, ConceptNet, and WordNet, with the ones existing in our knowledge graph. We offer a set of predefined SPARQL templates that directly address the ontology on which our knowledge retrieval framework is built, and querying capabilities through SPARQL. The framework can argue with the user about its answers with two different scenarios, missing where an entity should be in the answers of the framework, according to the user, and wrong where an entity should not be in the answers of the framework. We evaluated our framework via two different user evaluations.",1
Towards a Requirements Engineering Framework based on Semantics,2020,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3437120.3437278,"Requirements engineering is one of the most important issues in systems development. Whether it is software or hardware systems or embedded systems, the need for well-defined requirements remains the same. The ultimate success or failure of developing a system stems largely from the initial definition and management of its requirements. However, despite the efforts that have been made, a coherent and easily understood process that leads from the requirements to correct implementations is still an open research issue, which seeks alternative promising approaches. To this end, in this paper, we propose a requirements engineering approach based on Semantics. It provides a novel mechanism that combines semantics, ontologies, and appropriate NLP techniques. The ultimate goal is to propose a framework that will include the minimum consistent set of formalities and languages to determine the …",0
Altruist: argumentative explanations through local interpretations of predictive models,2020,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07650,"Interpretable machine learning is an emerging field providing solutions on acquiring insights into machine learning models' rationale. It has been put in the map of machine learning by suggesting ways to tackle key ethical and societal issues. However, existing techniques of interpretable machine learning are far from being comprehensible and explainable to the end user. Another key issue in this field is the lack of evaluation and selection criteria, making it difficult for the end user to choose the most appropriate interpretation technique for its use. In this study, we introduce a meta-explanation methodology that will provide truthful interpretations, in terms of feature importance, to the end user through argumentation. At the same time, this methodology can be used as an evaluation or selection tool for multiple interpretation techniques based on feature importance.",1
Mechanism Design for Efficient Online and Offline Allocation of Electric Vehicles to Charging Stations,2020,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09715,"We study the problem of allocating Electric Vehicles (EVs) to charging stations and scheduling their charging. We develop offline and online solutions that treat EV users as self-interested agents that aim to maximise their profit and minimise the impact on their schedule. We formulate the problem of the optimal EV to charging station allocation as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) one and we propose two pricing mechanisms: A fixed-price one, and another that is based on the well known Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) mechanism. Later, we develop online solutions that incrementally call the MIP-based algorithm. We empirically evaluate our mechanisms and we observe that both scale well. Moreover, the VCG mechanism services on average  more EVs than the fixed-price one. In addition, when the stations get congested, VCG leads to higher prices for the EVs and higher profit for the stations, but lower utility for the EVs. However, we theoretically prove that the VCG mechanism guarantees truthful reporting of the EVs' preferences. In contrast, the fixed-price one is vulnerable to agents' strategic behaviour as non-truthful EVs can charge in place of truthful ones. Finally, we observe that the online algorithms are on average at  of the optimal in EV satisfaction.",1
DRAMa: An IoT-enabled Distributed Reputation Agent Model,2018,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3200947.3201048,"The Internet of Things is a network of objects, called Things, which can interact with the environment or other Things, with no human intervention. At the same time, multi-agent systems are considered a modern medium of communication and interaction with limited or no human intervention. Hence, combining agent technology with the Internet of Things seems promising. Yet, the open, distributed and heterogeneous environment raises important challenges, such as trustworthiness among the various devices and participants. Hence, distributed reputation models inevitably attract more attention. In this paper we propose DRAMa, a distributed reputation model that provides a novel mechanism, combining reputation with risk and reward. DRAMa attempts to reverse the traditional view of reputation models by involving auctions in the decision making procedures. Finally, an evaluation of the model demonstrates the …",0

SENSE: A Flow-Down Semantics-Based Requirements Engineering Framework,2021,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/14/10/298,"The processes involved in requirements engineering are some of the most, if not the most, important steps in systems development. The need for well-defined requirements remains a critical issue for the development of any system. Describing the structure and behavior of a system could be proven vague, leading to uncertainties, restrictions, or improper functioning of the system that would be hard to fix later. In this context, this article proposes SENSE, a framework based on standardized expressions of natural language with well-defined semantics, called boilerplates, that support a flow-down procedure for requirement management. This framework integrates sets of boilerplates and proposes the most appropriate of them, depending, among other considerations, on the type of requirement and the developing system, while providing validity and completeness verification checks using the minimum consistent set of formalities and languages. SENSE is a consistent and easily understood framework that allows engineers to use formal languages and semantics rather than the traditional natural languages and machine learning techniques, optimizing the requirement development. The main aim of SENSE is to provide a complete process of the production and standardization of the requirements by using semantics, ontologies, and appropriate NLP techniques. Furthermore, SENSE performs the necessary verifications by using SPARQL (SPIN) queries to support requirement management.",1

Intelligent Momentary Assisted Control for Autonomous Emergency Braking,2021,https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00972,"Development of control algorithms for enhancing performance in safety-critical systems such as the Autonomous Emergency Braking system (AEB) is an important issue in the emerging field of automated electric vehicles. In this study, we design a safety distance-based hierarchical AEB control system constituted of a high-level Rule-Based Supervisory control module, an intermediate-level switching algorithm and a low-level control module. The Rule Based supervisor determines the required deceleration command that is fed to the low-level control module via the switching algorithm. In the low-level, two wheel slip control algorithms were developed, a Robust Sliding Mode controller and a Gain-Scheduled Linear Quadratic Regulator. For the needs of this control design, a non-linear dynamic vehicle model was implemented whereas a constant tire-road friction coefficient was considered. The proposed control system was validated in Simulink, assuming a straight-line braking maneuver on a flat dry road. The simulation results demonstrated satisfactory emergency braking performance with full collision avoidance in both proposed control system combinations.",1
LioNets: A Neural-Specific Local Interpretation Technique Exploiting Penultimate Layer Information,2021,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06057,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a tremendous impact on the unexpected growth of technology in almost every aspect. AI-powered systems are monitoring and deciding about sensitive economic and societal issues. The future is towards automation, and it must not be prevented. However, this is a conflicting viewpoint for a lot of people, due to the fear of uncontrollable AI systems. This concern could be reasonable if it was originating from considerations associated with social issues, like gender-biased, or obscure decision-making systems. Explainable AI (XAI) is recently treated as a huge step towards reliable systems, enhancing the trust of people to AI. Interpretable machine learning (IML), a subfield of XAI, is also an urgent topic of research. This paper presents a small but significant contribution to the IML community, focusing on a local-based, neural-specific interpretation process applied to textual and time-series data. The proposed methodology introduces new approaches to the presentation of feature importance based interpretations, as well as the production of counterfactual words on textual datasets. Eventually, an improved evaluation metric is introduced for the assessment of interpretation techniques, which supports an extensive set of qualitative and quantitative experiments.",1
Conclusive Local Interpretation Rules for Random Forests,2021,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06040,"In critical situations involving discrimination, gender inequality, economic damage, and even the possibility of casualties, machine learning models must be able to provide clear interpretations for their decisions.

In this paper, we present LionForests, which relies on a preliminary work of ours. LionForests is a random forest-specific interpretation technique, which provides rules as explanations. It is applicable from binary classification tasks to multi-class classification and regression tasks, and it is supported by a stable theoretical background. Experimentation, including sensitivity analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, is also performed to demonstrate the efficacy of our contribution. Finally, we highlight a unique property of LionForests, called conclusiveness, that provides interpretation validity and distinguishes it from previous techniques.",1

Deploying a semantically-enabled content management system in a state university,2010,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15172-9_24,"Public institutes often face the challenge of managing vast volumes of administrative documents, a need that is often met via Content Management Systems (CMSs). CMSs offer various advantages, like separation of data structure from presentation and variety in user roles, but also present certain disadvantages, like inefficient keyword-based search facilities. The new generation of content management solutions imports the notion of semantics and is based on Semantic Web technologies, such as metadata and ontologies. The benefits include semantic interoperability, competitive advantages and dramatic cost reduction. In this paper a leading Enterprise CMS is extended with semantic capabilities for automatically importing and exporting ontologies. This functionality enables reuse of repository content, semantically-enabled search and interoperability with third-party applications. The extended system is …",0

An agent-based negotiation scheme for the distribution of electric vehicles across a set of charging stations,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X19301716,"We consider the problem of scheduling Electric Vehicle (EV) charging within a set of multiple charging stations. Each station aims to maximize the amount of charged energy and the number of charged EVs. We propose an agent-based simulation scheme, where the EVs announce their requests to the stations and each station computes an optimal solution using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) techniques. We propose two variations of the problem, namely the Offline Mode and the Online Mode. In the first one, all the EVs send their charging requests simultaneously at the beginning of the simulation and the stations compute their charging schedules at once, while in the second one each EV may send a charging request at whichever time point and the stations compute their charging schedules incrementally. Moreover, we apply agent-based negotiation techniques between the stations and the EVs to service EVs …",0
Towards an Object-Oriented Reasoning System for OWL.,2005,http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-188/sub9.pdf,"In this paper we present O-DEVICE, a deductive object-oriented knowledge base system for reasoning over OWL documents. O-DEVICE imports OWL documents into the CLIPS production rule system by transforming OWL ontologies into an object-oriented schema of the CLIPS Object-Oriented Language (COOL) and instances of OWL classes into COOL objects. The purpose of this transformation is to be able to use a deductive object-oriented rule language for reasoning about OWL data. The O-DEVICE data model for OWL ontologies maps classes to classes, resources to objects, property types to class slot (or attribute) definitions and encapsulates resource properties inside resource objects, as traditional OO attributes (or slots). In this way, when accessing properties of a single resource, few joins are required. O-DEVICE is an extension of a previous system, called R-DEVICE, which effectively maps RDF Schema and data into COOL objects and then reasons over RDF data using a deductive object-oriented rule language.",1
Lazy adaptive multicriteria planning,2004,http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/publications/tsoumakas-ecai04.pdf,"This paper describes a learning system for the automatic configuration of domain independent planning systems, based on measurable features of planning problems. The purpose of the Lazy Adaptive Multicriteria Planning (LAMP) system is to configure a planner in an optimal way, concerning two quality metrics (ie execution speed and plan quality), for a given problem according to user-specified preferences. The training data are produced by running the planner under consideration on a set of problems using all possible parameter configurations and recording the planning time and the plan length. When a new problem arises, LAMP extracts the values for a number of domain-expert specified problem features and uses them to identify the а nearest problems solved in the past. The system then performs a multicriteria combination of the performances of the retrieved problems according to user-specified weights that specify the relative importance of the quality metrics and selects the configuration with the best score. Experimental results show that LAMP improves the performance of the default configuration of two already well-performing planning systems in a variety of planning problems.",1
Using logic for querying XML data,2003,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/web-powered-databases/31422,"In this chapter, we propose the use of first-order logic, in the form of deductive database rules, as a query language for XML data, and we present X-Device, an extension of the deductive object-oriented database system Device, for storing and querying XML data.

Algorithms for electric vehicle scheduling in mobility-on-demand schemes,2015,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7313312/,"We study a setting where electric vehicles (EVs) can be hired to drive from pick-up to drop-off points in a mobility-on-demand (MoD) scheme. Each point in the MoD scheme is equipped with a battery swap facility that helps cope with the EVs' limited range. The goal of the system is to maximise the number of customers that are serviced. Thus, we first model and solve this problem optimally using Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) techniques and show that the solution scales up to medium sized problems. Given this, we develop a greedy heuristic algorithm that is shown to generate near-optimal solutions and can scale to thousands of consumer requests and EVs. Both algorithms are evaluated in a setting using data of real locations of shared vehicle pick-up and drop-off stations and the greedy algorithm is shown to be on average 90% of the optimal in terms of average task completion.",1

Main-memory database systems suffer more since the database processing cost is small compared to disk-based database systems and thus comparable to the processor initialization cost. The usual uniform data fragmentation strategy divides a relation into equal data partitions, leading to idleness of single processors after local query execution termination and before global termination. In this paper, we propose a new, non-uniform data fragmentation strategy that results in concurrent termination of query processing among all the processors. The proposed fragmentation strategy is analytically modeled, simulated and compared to the uniform strategy. It is proven that the non-uniform fragmentation strategy offers inherently better performance for a parallel database system than the uniform strategy. Furthermore, the non-uniform strategy scales-up perfectly till an upper limit, after which a system re-configuration is needed.",1

A deductive object-oriented database system based on active rules,1997,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.28.7893&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"This paper describes a Deductive Object-Oriented Database (DOOD) system that is built on top of an active Object-Oriented Database (OODB) system. The system, named DEVICE, uses the primitives of the latter, like active rules, simple and complex events, to integrate deductive and production rules. The integration is based on the emulation of deductive rules by special purpose if-then-else production rules that have been smoothly integrated into an active OODB. The DEVICE system supports thus multiple rule systems, like active (event-driven), production (data-driven) and deductive (goal-driven) rules into the same OODB system. The core of this multiple rule integration is: a) the mapping of each high-level rule into one event-driven rule, offering centralised rule selection control for correct run-time behaviour and conflict resolution, and b) the use of complex events to map the conditions of high-level rules and monitor the database to incrementally match those conditions. DEVICE is extensible because a) it reuses the primitives of the host active OODB system to build the integration scheme, without introducing low-level data structures that do not blend well with the OO model and are not easily extensible, and b) the rule managers support general-purpose rule scheduling functions. In conclusion, DEVICE is a flexible Knowledge Base System (KBS) that gives the user the ability to express knowledge in a variety of high-level forms for advanced problem solving in data intensive applications.",1

A Multi Attack Argumentation Framework,2021,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89391-0_23,"This paper presents a novel abstract argumentation framework, called Multi-Attack Argumentation Framework (MAAF), which supports different types of attacks. The introduction of types gives rise to a new family of non-standard semantics which can support applications that classical approaches cannot, while also allowing classical semantics as a special case. The main novelty of the proposed semantics is the discrimination among two different roles that attacks play, namely an attack as a generator of conflicts, and an attack as a means to defend an argument. These two roles have traditionally been considered together in the argumentation literature. Allowing some attack types to serve one of those roles only, gives rise to the different semantics presented here.",1
Ontology-based sentiment analysis of twitter posts,2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417413000043,"The emergence of Web 2.0 has drastically altered the way users perceive the Internet, by improving information sharing, collaboration and interoperability.

Over time, these systems have been proven a really powerful tool for modelling and understanding phenomena in fields, such as economics and trading, health care, urban planning and social sciences. However, although, intelligent agents have been around for years, their actual implementation is still in its early stages. Since the late nineties many agent platforms have been developed. Some of them have already been abandoned whereas others continue releasing new versions. On the other hand, the agent-oriented research community is still providing more and more new platforms. This vast amount of platform options leads to a high degree of heterogeneity. Hence, a common problem is how people interested in using multi-agent systems should choose which platform to use in order to benefit from agent technology. This decision was usually left to word of mouth, past experiences or platform publicity, lately however people depend on solid survey articles. To date, in most cases multi-agent system surveys describe only the basic characteristics of a few representatives without even providing any classification of the systems themselves. This article presents a comparative up-to-date review of the most promising existing agent platforms that can be used. It is based on universal comparison and evaluation criteria, proposing classifications for helping readers to understand which agent platforms broadly exhibit similar properties and in which situations which choices should be made.",1
Managing electric vehicles in the smart grid using artificial intelligence: A survey,2014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7000557/,"Along with the development of smart grids, the wide adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as a catalyst to the reduction of CO 2  emissions and more intelligent transportation systems. In particular, EVs augment the grid with the ability to store energy at some points in the network and give it back at others and, therefore, help optimize the use of energy from intermittent renewable energy sources and let users refill their cars in a variety of locations. However, a number of challenges need to be addressed if such benefits are to be achieved. On the one hand, given their limited range and costs involved in charging EV batteries, it is important to design algorithms that will minimize costs and, at the same time, avoid users being stranded. On the other hand, collectives of EVs need to be organized in such a way as to avoid peaks on the grid that may result in high electricity prices and overload local distribution grids. In …",0
An integrated approach to automated semantic web service composition through planning,2011,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5744077/,"The paper presents an integrated approach for automated semantic web service composition using AI planning techniques. An important advantage of this approach is that the composition process, as well as the discovery of the atomic services that take part in the composition, are significantly facilitated by the incorporation of semantic information. OWL-S web service descriptions are transformed into a planning problem described in a standardized fashion using PDDL, while semantic information is used for the enhancement of the composition process as well as for approximating the optimal composite service when exact solutions are not found. Solving, visualization, manipulation, and evaluation of the produced composite services are accomplished, while, unlike other systems, independence from specific planners is maintained. Implementation was performed through the development and integration of two …",0

Semantically aware web service composition through AI planning,2015,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218213014500158,"Web service composition is a significant problem as the number of available web services increases; however, manual composition is not an efficient option. Automated web service composition can be performed using AI Planning techniques, utilizing descriptions of available atomic web services, enhanced with semantic awareness and relaxation.

Agent reasoning on the web using web services,2014,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=1820-02141400038B,"In this paper we present an approach for reusing agent-based reasoning    capabilities by making them available for invocation as Web services. In this    way, we provide the missing link between the highly interoperable Web    services and the autonomicity and intelligence of agent-based systems, so    that the latter can be seamlessly integrated into the knowledge-rich    SemanticWeb environment without being compromised by isolated communication    platforms and languages or restricted to only one or just few reasoning    formalisms. We have achieved this by extending the EMERALD framework for    agent based reasoning with a Web service interface. Our approach is    exemplified by the development of an online system for intelligent brokering    of apartment rentals. The broker intelligence is captured as a defeasible    knowledge base, while its problem solving process involves the invocation of    third party defeasible reasoning Web services included into the EMERALD    framework.",1
Harm: A hybrid rule-based agent reputation model based on temporal defeasible logic,2012,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32689-9_15,"Multi-agent systems are considered a modern medium of communication and interaction with limited or no human intervention. As intelligent agents are gradually enriched with Semantic Web technology, their use is constantly increasing. To this end, the degree of trust that can be invested in a certain agent is recognized as a vital issue. Current trust models are mainly based on agents’ direct experience (interaction trust) or reports provided by others (witness reputation). Though, lately, some combinations of them (hybrid models) were also proposed. To overcome their main drawbacks, in this paper we propose HARM, a hybrid, rule-based reputation model based on temporal defeasible logic. It combines the advantages of the hybrid approach and the benefits of a rule-based reputation modeling approach, providing a stable and realistic estimation mechanism with low bandwidth and computational …",0

Our work merges the field of collaborative learning with the field of semantic web and provides a framework for the formalization of collaboration scripts using the OWL language. Collaboration scripts are didactic scenarios that prescribe learners’ interactions in collaborative settings. A script comprises a number of phases and each phase specifies the activity that learners have to perform, the composition of the group, the distribution of the activity, the mode of interaction and the phase duration. Scripts can also be positioned along various design dimensions, such as their granularity, coercion degree and locus of control. The presented ontology is being developed with the purpose of formalizing scripts in order to promote their reusability and portability between various computer-supported learning platforms. We discuss design decisions and illustrate how this ontology could be beneficial when embedded in a knowledge-based system that supports collaborative learning.",1

Although the percentage of energy savings may seem low, the greatest merit of the method is ensuring that no energy is wasted by constantly enforcing the policies.",1

The main advantages of PersoNews are the aggregation of many different news sources, machine learning filtering offering personalization not only per user but also for every feed a user is subscribed to, and finally the ability for every user to watch a more abstracted topic of interest by employing a simple form of semantic filtering through a taxonomy of topics.",1
An ontology-based decision support tool for optimizing domestic solar hot water system selection,2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615011798,"In an effort to tackle climate change most countries utilize renewable energy sources. This is more pronounced in the building sector, which is currently one of the major consumers of energy, mostly in the form of heat. In order to further promote the use of domestic solar hot water systems in buildings, an ontology-based decision support tool has been developed and is presented in this paper. The proposed tool aids non-technical consumers to select a domestic solar hot water system tailored to their needs, containing up-to-date information on its components and interrelationships, installation costs etc., in the form of an ontology formulated in OWL (Web Ontology Language). The optimum system configurations are computed based on various specific parameters, such as number of occupants, daily hot water requirements and house location. The backbone of the proposed system is an ontology that represents the …",0
Visualizing Semantic Web proofs of defeasible logic in the DR-DEVICE system,2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705110001735,"The Semantic Web aims at improving the current Web, by augmenting its content with semantics and encouraging the cooperation among human users and machines. Since the basic Semantic Web infrastructure is reaching sufficient maturity, research efforts are shifting towards logic, proof and trust and rule-based systems inevitably concentrate most of the attention. Nevertheless, in order for human users to trust system answers, they have to be presented with adequate explanations that justify the derived results. And, even more importantly, these explanations have to be presented in a user-comprehensible format. Consequently, the focus in this work is on humans and the research area called proof visualization that features three main approaches: tree-based, graphical and logical/textual. Since each of the approaches presents advantages and disadvantages, this article proposes a fourth, hybrid visualization …",0
On the combination of textual and semantic descriptions for automated semantic web service classification,2009,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0221-4_13,"Semantic Web services have emerged as the solution to the need for automating several aspects related to service-oriented architectures, such as service discovery and composition, and they are realized by combining Semantic Web technologies and Web service standards. In the present paper, we tackle the problem of automated classification of Web services according to their application domain taking into account both the textual description and the semantic annotations of OWL-S advertisements. We present results that we obtained by applying machine learning algorithms on textual and semantic descriptions separately and we propose methods for increasing the overall classification accuracy through an extended feature vector and an ensemble of classifiers.",1
SPARSE: A symptom-based antipattern retrieval knowledge-based system using Semantic Web technologies,2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417410014600,"Antipatterns provide information on commonly occurring solutions to problems that generate negative consequences. The number of software project management antipatterns that appears in the literature and the Web increases to the extent that makes using antipatterns problematic. Furthermore, antipatterns are usually inter-related and rarely appear in isolation. As a result, detecting which antipatterns exist in a software project is a challenging task which requires expert knowledge. This paper proposes SPARSE, an OWL ontology based knowledge-based system that aims to assist software project managers in the antipattern detection process. The antipattern ontology documents antipatterns and how they are related with other antipatterns through their causes, symptoms and consequences. The semantic relationships that derive from the antipattern definitions are determined using the Pellet DL reasoner and …",0
A defeasible logic reasoner for the semantic web,2004,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30504-0_5,"Defeasible reasoning is a rule-based approach for efficient reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent information. Such reasoning is, among others, useful for ontology integration, where conflicting information arises naturally; and for the modeling of business rules and policies, where rules with exceptions are often used. This paper describes these scenarios in more detail, and reports on the implementation of a system for defeasible reasoning on the Web. The system is called DR-DEVICE and is capable of reasoning about RDF metadata over multiple Web sources using defeasible logic rules. The system is implemented on top of CLIPS production rule system and builds upon R-DEVICE, an earlier deductive rule system over RDF metadata that also supports derived attribute and aggregate attribute rules. Rules can be expressed either in a native CLIPS-like language, or in an extension of the OO …",0
Monitoring water quality through a telematic sensor network and a fuzzy expert system,2007,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0394.2007.00426.x," In this paper we present an expert system that monitors seawater quality and pollution in northern Greece through a sensor network called Andromeda. The expert system monitors sensor data collected by local monitoring stations and reasons about the current level of water suitability for various aquatic uses, such as swimming and piscicultures. The aim of the expert system is to help the authorities in the decision‐making process in the battle against pollution of the aquatic environment, which is vital for public health and the economy of northern Greece. The expert system determines, using fuzzy logic, when certain environmental parameters exceed certain pollution limits, which are specified either by the authorities or by environmental scientists, and flags up appropriate alerts.",1
R-DEVICE: an object-oriented knowledge base for RDF metadata,2006,https://www.igi-global.com/article/device-object-oriented-knowledge-base/2819,"In this paper we present R-DEVICE, a deductive object-oriented knowledge base system for reasoning over RDF metadata. R-DEVICE imports RDF documents into the CLIPS production rule system by transforming RDF triples into COOL objects and uses a deductive rule language for reasoning about them. R-DEVICE is based on an OO RDF data model, different than the established triple-based model, which maps resources to objects and encapsulates properties inside resource objects, as traditional OO attributes. In this way, fewer joins are required to access the properties of a single resource resulting in better inferencing/querying performance, as it is experimentally shown in the paper. Furthermore, RDF can interoperate seamlessly with other Web data models and languages. The descriptive semantics of RDF may call for dynamic redefinitions of resource classes, which are handled by R-DEVICE effectively …",0
A semantic recommendation algorithm for the PaaSport platform-as-a-service marketplace,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417416305164,"Platform as a service (PaaS) is one of the Cloud computing services that provide a computing platform in the Cloud, allowing customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. The primary disadvantage for an SME to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating SMEs to deploy business applications on the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non-intrusive Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables PaaS provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that has been defined as an OWL ontology.

Towards an optimal EV charging scheduling scheme with V2G and V2V energy transfer,2016,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7778778/,"In this paper we propose an optimal Electric Vehicle (EV) charging scheduling scheme with the option of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy transfer. In this way, we aim to increase customer satisfaction as well as energy utilization compared to settings where only energy from the grid exists. We assume a single charging station to exist and we present three alternative formulations of the problem of V2G and V2V energy transfer: (a) without additional energy from the grid, (b) with additional energy from the grid, and (c) with additional energy from the grid and battery backup storage. In all cases, we formulate the problems using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and solve them off-line and optimally. We evaluate our algorithms in a setting partially using real data regarding energy production from photo-voltaic panels in Belgium and we observe that solution (c) leads to 24% increase in EV …",0
Deploying defeasible logic rule bases for the semantic web,2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X08000220,"Logic is currently the target of the majority of the upcoming efforts towards the realization of the Semantic Web vision, namely making the content of the Web accessible not only to humans, as it is today, but to machines as well. Defeasible reasoning, a rule-based approach to reasoning with incomplete and conflicting information, is a powerful tool in many Semantic Web applications. Despite its strong mathematical background, logic, in general, and defeasible logic, in particular, may overload the user with tons of additional complex semantic relationships among data and metadata of the Semantic Web. To this end, a comprehensible, visual representation of these semantic relationships (rules) would help users understand them and make more use of them.

The proposed solution uses the Semantic Web standard of RDF to represent the offerings, and a deductive logical language for expressing the requirements and preferences. We motivate and explain the approach and architecture we propose, and report on a system implementing the described functionality in a multi-agent environment.

"A combinatory framework of Web 2.0 mashup tools, OWL-S and UDDI",2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417410013102,"The increasing number of Web 2.0 applications, such as wikis or social networking sites, indicates a movement to large-scale collaborative and social Web activities. Users can share information, add value to Web applications by using them or aggregate data from different sources creating Web applications (mashups) using specialized tools (mashup tools). However, Web 2.0 is not a new technology, but it rather embraces a new philosophy, treating the Internet as a platform. Several issues related to the Semantic Web vision, such as interoperability or machine understandable data semantics, are not tackled by Web 2.0. In this paper, we present our effort to combine semantic Web services (SWS) discovery frameworks, UDDI repositories and existing mashup tools in order to enhance the procedure of developing mashups with semantic mashup discovery capabilities.

Offline and online electric vehicle charging scheduling with V2V energy transfer,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8710609/,"We propose offline and online scheduling algorithms for the charging of electric vehicles (EVs) in a single charging station (CS). The station has available cheaper, but limited, energy from renewable energy sources (RES). The EVs are capable of and willing to participate in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy transfers that are used to reduce the charging cost and increase the RES utilization. The algorithms are centralized and aim to minimize the total charging cost for the EVs. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) one and we solve it optimally assuming full knowledge of the EV demand and energy generation. Later, we propose an online algorithm that iteratively calls the offline one and copes with unknown future interruptions by arriving the EVs and with the inability to predict accurately RES production. In addition, a novel technique called virtual demand is developed that increases the …",0

On Discovering Deterministic Relationships in Multi-Label Learning via Linked Open Data.,2015,https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/papagiannopoulou-knowlod-15.pdf,"In multi-label learning, each instance can be related with one or more binary target variables. Multi-label learning problems are commonly found in many applications, eg in text classification where a news article is possible to be both on politics and finance. The main motivation of multi-label learning algorithms is the exploitation of label dependencies in order to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we present ongoing work on a method that uses the linked open data cloud to detect relationships between labels, enriches the set of labels with new concepts which are super classes of two or more labels, trains a model on the enhanced training set and finally, makes predictions on the enhanced test set in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the initial labels.",1
S2-REd: A Semantic Web Rule Editor,2012,https://www.academia.edu/download/30724479/swc2012_submission_11.pdf,"A key factor in the further progress of the Semantic Web is the development and wide-spread usage of rule-and logic-based applications. However, there is an evident lack of software tools that can assist end-users in developing such applications. Consequently, users usually resort to more generic tools that offer support at a syntactic level, but prove inadequate in semantically supporting the user. This paper presents S2REd, a Semantic Web rule editor that introduces a supplementary layer of semantic assistance during rule base development. The tool offers semantic assistance via:(i) The Semantic Tag Mapping window that provides a meta-modeling facility for generating schemas over various rule language versions and,(ii) the Namespace Dialog window, for loading ontologies that serve as the underlying vocabulary for expressing rule atoms. S2REd assists in developing RuleML rule bases, but is equally suitable for any other XML-based syntax for representing rule sets.",1
