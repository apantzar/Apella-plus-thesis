In particular, urban traffic has been in the eye of the storm for many years now and gathers increasing interest as cities become bigger, crowded and ‘smart’. This paper examines the likely impact of the work of the EU-funded FP7 INSIGHT programme on traffic incident detection and its amelioration in Dublin city.",1
On the combination of two decompositive multi-label classification methods,2009,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.192.3699&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=118,"In this paper, we compare and combine two approaches for multi-label classification that both decompose the initial problem into sets of smaller problems. The Calibrated Label Ranking approach is based on interpreting the multi-label problem as a preference learning problem and decomposes it into a quadratic number of binary classifiers. The HOMER approach reduces the original problem into a hierarchy of considerably simpler multi-label problems. Experimental results indicate that the use of HOMER is beneficial for the pairwise preference-based approach in terms of computational cost and quality of prediction.",1

A hybrid deep learning network for modelling opinionated content,2019,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3297280.3297570,"The ability to accurately understand opinionated content is critical for a large set of applications. Models targeting at learning from such content should overcome the inherent difficulties of the data. We propose a novel hybrid neural network embedded in a deep learning framework that can be used for sentiment classification. Our method consists of an independent set of feed forward learning models that are able to identify rich linguistic patterns through recurrent semantic trees. We evaluate our method in four sentiment classification problems that include both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Moreover, we compare our model's prediction accuracy with state-of-the-art methods. We observe that our method outperforms the alternative approaches. The strengths of the proposed approach are due to i) a novel Convolutional Neural Network which can be employed autonomously or as part of a greater …",0
Linguistic Bias in Crowdsourced Biographies: A Cross-lingual Examination,2019,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813274884_0012,"Biographies make up a significant portion of Wikipedia entries and are a source of information and inspiration for the public. We examine a threat to their objectivity, linguistic biases, which are pervasive in human communication. Linguistic bias, the systematic asymmetry in the language used to describe people as a function of their social groups, plays a role in the perpetuation of stereotypes. Theory predicts that we describe people who are expected — because they are members of our own in-groups or are stereotype-congruent — with more abstract, subjective language, as compared to others. Abstract language has the power to sway our impressions of others as it implies stability over time. Extending our monolingual work, we consider biographies of intellectuals at the English- and Greek-language Wikipedia. We use our recently introduced sentiment analysis tool, DidaxTo, which extracts domain-specific …",0
"REMI, Reusable Elements for Multi-Level Information Availability",2017,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3093742.3095091,"Applications targeting Smart Cities tackle common challenges, however solutions are seldom portable from one city to another due to the heterogeneity of city ecosystems. A major obstacle involves the differences in the levels of available information. In this demonstration we present REMI, a reusable elements framework to handle varying degrees of information availability by design from two complementary angles, namely graceful degradation (GRADE) and data enrichment (DARE). In a nutshell, we develop reusable machine learning black boxes for mining and aggregating streaming data, either to infer missing data from available data, or to adapt expected accuracy based on data availability. We illustrate the proposed approach using tram data from the city of Warsaw.",1
Mining hidden constrained streams in practice: informed search in dynamic filter spaces,2016,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752293/,"In this paper we tackle the recently proposed problem of hidden streams. In many situations, the data stream that we are interested in, is not directly accessible. Instead, part of the data can be accessed only through applying filters (e.g. keyword filtering). In fact this is the case of the most discussed social stream today, Twitter. The problem in this case is how to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible by applying the most appropriate set of filters to the original stream and, at the same time, respect a number of constrains (e.g. maximum number of filters that can be applied). In this work we introduce a search approach on a dynamic filter space. We utilize heterogeneous filters (not only keywords) making no assumptions about the attributes of the individual filters. We advance current research by considering realistically hard constraints based on real-world scenarios that require tracking of multiple dynamic …",0

PersoNews: a personalized news reader enhanced by machine learning and semantic filtering,2006,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11914853_62,"In this paper, we present a web-based, machine-learning enhanced news reader (PersoNews). The main advantages of PersoNews are the aggregation of many different news sources, machine learning filtering offering personalization not only per user but also for every feed a user is subscribed to, and finally the ability for every user to watch a more abstracted topic of interest by employing a simple form of semantic filtering through a taxonomy of topics.",1
On the Combination of Textual and Semantic Descriptions for Automated Semantic Web Service Classification,2009,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0221-4_13,"Semantic Web services have emerged as the solution to the need for automating several aspects related to service-oriented architectures, such as service discovery and composition, and they are realized by combining Semantic Web technologies and Web service standards. In the present paper, we tackle the problem of automated classification of Web services according to their application domain taking into account both the textual description and the semantic annotations of OWL-S advertisements. We present results that we obtained by applying machine learning algorithms on textual and semantic descriptions separately and we propose methods for increasing the overall classification accuracy through an extended feature vector and an ensemble of classifiers.",1
Email mining: Emerging techniques for email management,2006,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/web-data-management-practices/31103,"Email has met tremendous popularity over the past few years. People are sending and receiving many messages per day, communicating with partners and friends, or exchanging files and information. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of email overload has grown over the past years becoming a personal headache for users and a financial issue for companies. In this chapter, we will discuss how disciplines like Machine Learning and Data Mining can contribute to the solution of the problem by constructing intelligent techniques which automate email managing tasks and what advantages they hold over other conventional solutions. We will also discuss the particularity of email data and what special treatment it requires. Some interesting email mining applications like mail categorization, summarization, automatic answering and spam filtering will be also presented.",1

On the utility of incremental feature selection for the classification of textual data streams,2005,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11573036_32,"In this paper we argue that incrementally updating the features that a text classification algorithm considers is very important for real-world textual data streams, because in most applications the distribution of data and the description of the classification concept changes over time. We propose the coupling of an incremental feature ranking method and an incremental learning algorithm that can consider different subsets of the feature vector during prediction (what we call a feature based classifier), in order to deal with the above problem. Experimental results with a longitudinal database of real spam and legitimate emails shows that our approach can adapt to the changing nature of streaming data and works much better than classical incremental learning algorithms.",1

An adaptive personalized news dissemination system,2009,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10844-008-0053-8.pdf,"With the explosive growth of the Word Wide Web, information overload became a crucial concern. In a data-rich information-poor environment like the Web, the discrimination of useful or desirable information out of tons of mostly worthless data became a tedious task. The role of Machine Learning in tackling this problem is thoroughly discussed in the literature, but few systems are available for public use. In this work, we bridge theory to practice, by implementing a web-based news reader enhanced with a specifically designed machine learning framework for dynamic content personalization. This way, we get the chance to examine applicability and implementation issues and discuss the effectiveness of machine learning methods for the classification of real-world text streams. The main features of our system named PersoNews are: (a) the aggregation of many different news sources that offer an RSS …",0
Effective voting of heterogeneous classifiers,2004,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30115-8_43,"This paper deals with the combination of classification models that have been derived from running different (heterogeneous) learning algorithms on the same data set. We focus on the Classifier Evaluation and Selection (ES) method, that evaluates each of the models (typically using 10-fold cross-validation) and selects the best one. We examine the performance of this method in comparison with the Oracle selecting the best classifier for the test set and show that 10-fold cross-validation has problems in detecting the best classifier. We then extend ES by applying a statistical test to the 10-fold accuracies of the models and combining through voting the most significant ones. Experimental results show that the proposed method, Effective Voting, performs comparably with the state-of-the-art method of Stacking with Multi-Response Model Trees without the additional computational cost of meta-training.",1
An ensemble of classifiers for coping with recurring contexts in data streams,2008,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/4488,"This paper proposes a general framework for classifying data streams by exploiting incremental clustering in order to dynamically build and update an ensemble of incremental classifiers. To achieve this, a transformation function that maps batches of examples into a new conceptual feature space is proposed. The clustering algorithm is then applied in order to group different concepts and identify recurring contexts. The ensemble is produced by maintaining an classifier for every concept discovered in the stream",1

Detection and Delineation of Events and Sub-Events in Social Networks,2018,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LGSAsylIL6T,"We define and solve the problem of event detection and delineation as a task of identifying events and decomposing them to their major sub-events, with a description and a timeline. We propose DeLi, an algorithm that focuses on providing such an understanding of events and sub-events. DeLi, to the best of our knowledge, is the first method that addresses the problem in a generic stream of text, and in an online fashion. Extensive evaluation on social streaming data demonstrates that, by combining the structure of a social network with content attributes, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.",1
Understanding Online Political Networks: The Case of the Far-Right and Far-Left in Greece,2017,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67217-5_11,"This paper examines the connectivity among political networks on Twitter. We explore dynamics inside and between the far right and the far left, as well as the relation between the structure of the network and sentiment. The 2015 Greek political context offers a unique opportunity to investigate political communication in times of political intensity and crisis. We explore interactions inside and between political networks on Twitter in the run up to the elections of three different ballots: the parliamentary election of 25 January, the bailout referendum of 5 July, the snap election of 20 September; we, then, compare political action during campaigns with that during routinized politics.",1
Language agnostic meme-filtering for hashtag-based social network analysis,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-015-0271-3,"Users in social networks utilize hashtags for a variety of reasons. In many cases, hashtags serve retrieval purposes by labeling the content they accompany. More often than not, hashtags are used to promote content, ideas, or conversations producing viral memes. This paper addresses a specific case of hashtag classification: meme-filtering. We argue that hashtags that are correlated with memes may hinder many valuable social media algorithms like trend detection and event identification. We propose and evaluate a set of language-agnostic features that aid the separation of these two classes: meme-hashtags and event-hashtags. The proposed approach is evaluated on two large datasets of Twitter messages written in English and German. A proof-of-concept application of the meme-filtering approach to the problem of event detection is presented.",1

Automated Tagging for the Retrieval of Software Resources in Grid and Cloud Infrastructures,2012,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6217475/,"A key challenge for Grid and Cloud infrastructures is to make their services easily accessible and attractive to end-users. In this paper we introduce tagging capabilities to the Miner soft system, a powerful tool for software search and discovery in order to help end-users locate application software suitable to their needs. Miner soft is now able to predict and automatically assign tags to software resources it indexes. In order to achieve this, we model the problem of tag prediction as a multi-label classification problem. Using data extracted from production-quality Grid and Cloud computing infrastructures, we evaluate an important number of multi-label classifiers and discuss which one and with what settings is the most appropriate for use in the particular problem.",1
Effective and efficient multilabel classification in domains with large number of labels,2008,http://www.ecmlpkdd2008.org/files/pdf/workshops/mmd/4.pdf,"This paper contributes a novel algorithm for effective and computationally efficient multilabel classification in domains with large label sets L. The HOMER algorithm constructs a Hierarchy Of Multilabel classifiERs, each one dealing with a much smaller set of labels compared to L and a more balanced example distribution. This leads to improved predictive performance along with linear training and logarithmic testing complexities with respect to| L|. Label distribution from parent to children nodes is achieved via a new balanced clustering algorithm, called balanced k means.",1
Multilabel text classification for automated tag suggestion,2008,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.183.2636&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"The increased popularity of tagging during the last few years can be mainly attributed to its embracing by most of the recently thriving user-centric content publishing and management Web 2.0 applications. However, tagging systems have some limitations that have led researchers to develop methods that assist users in the tagging process, by automatically suggesting an appropriate set of tags. We have tried to model the automated tag suggestion problem as a multilabel text classification task in order to participate in the ECML/PKDD 2008 Discovery Challenge.",1
Tracking recurring contexts using ensemble classifiers: an application to email filtering,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-009-0206-2,"Concept drift constitutes a challenging problem for the machine learning and data mining community that frequently appears in real world stream classification problems. It is usually defined as the unforeseeable concept change of the target variable in a prediction task. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recurring contexts, a special sub-type of concept drift, that has not yet met the proper attention from the research community. In the case of recurring contexts, concepts may re-appear in future and thus older classification models might be beneficial for future classifications. We propose a general framework for classifying data streams by exploiting stream clustering in order to dynamically build and update an ensemble of incremental classifiers. To achieve this, a transformation function that maps batches of examples into a new conceptual representation model is proposed. The clustering algorithm is …",0

Mining Twitter Data with Resource Constraints,2014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6927538/,"Social media analysis constitutes a scientific field that is rapidly gaining ground due to its numerous research challenges and practical applications, as well as the unprecedented availability of data in real time. Several of these applications have significant social and economical impact, such as journalism, crisis management, advertising, etc. However, two issues regarding these applications have to be confronted. The first one is the financial cost. Despite the abundance of information, it typically comes at a premium price, and only a fraction is provided free of charge. For example, Twitter, a predominant social media online service, grants researchers and practitioners free access to only a small proportion (1%) of its publicly available stream. The second issue is the computational cost. Even when the full stream is available, off the shelf approaches are unable to operate in such settings due to the real-time …",0

Correlation analysis of forecasting methods: The case of the M4 competition,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301207,"This commentary introduces a correlation analysis of the top-10 ranked forecasting methods that participated in the M4 forecasting competition. The “M” competitions attempt to promote and advance research in the field of forecasting by inviting both industry and academia to submit forecasting algorithms for evaluation over a large corpus of real-world datasets. After performing the initial analysis to derive the errors of each method, we proceed to investigate the pairwise correlations among them in order to understand the extent to which they produce errors in similar ways. Based on our results, we conclude that there is indeed a certain degree of correlation among the top-10 ranked methods, largely due to the fact that many of them consist of a combination of well-known, statistical and machine learning techniques. This fact has a strong impact on the results of the correlation analysis, and therefore leads to similar …",0

Hierarchical partitioning of the output space in multi-label data,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X17304512,"Hierarchy Of Multi-label classifiERs (HOMER) is a multi-label learning algorithm that breaks the initial learning task to several, easier sub-tasks by first constructing a hierarchy of labels from a given label set and secondly employing a given base multi-label classifier (MLC) to the resulting sub-problems.

Random k-labelsets for multilabel classification,2011,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5567103/,"A simple yet effective multilabel learning method, called label powerset (LP), considers each distinct combination of labels that exist in the training set as a different class value of a single-label classification task. The computational efficiency and predictive performance of LP is challenged by application domains with large number of labels and training examples. In these cases, the number of classes may become very large and at the same time many classes are associated with very few training examples. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small random subsets, called labelsets and employing LP to train a corresponding classifier. The labelsets can be either disjoint or overlapping depending on which of two strategies is used to construct them. The proposed method is called RAkEL (RAndom k labELsets), where k is a parameter that specifies the size …",0

Foreword to the special issue on mining actionable insights from social networks,2018,http://profdoc.um.ac.ir/paper-abstract-1072213.html,"In the last 10 years, the dissemination and use of social networks have grown significantly worldwide. Online social networks have billions of users and are able to record hundreds of data from each of its users. The wide adoption of social networks resulted in an ocean of data which presents an interesting opportunity for performing data mining and knowledge discovery in a real-world context. The enormity and high variance of the information that propagates through large user communities influences the public discourse in society and sets trends and agendas in topics that range from marketing, education, business and medicine to politics, technology and the entertainment industry. Mining the contents of social networks provides an opportunity to discover social structure characteristics, analyze action patterns qualitatively and quantitatively, and gives the ability to predict future events. In recent years, decision makers have become savvy about how to translate social data into actionable information in order to leverage them for a competitive edge. Moreover, social networks expose different aspects of the social behavior of its users. In this respect, many users of the social networks are known as influencers. The influencers are users that usually publish their opinions about different topics, products and services on the social networks, and then affect intentionally or unintentionally the opinions, emotions, or behaviors of other users on the social networks. Because of the high impact of influencers on the opinions and behaviors of other users, many companies and organizations are interested in discovering influencers on social networks to …",0

Efficient and timely misinformation blocking under varying cost constraints,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468696417300113,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communication channels and are widely utilized as news sources. Information spreads widely and rapidly in OSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However, it is not uncommon for misinformation to propagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects, especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events. Therefore, it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, ie, misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news …",0
Learning patterns for discovering domain-oriented opinion words,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-017-1072-y,"Sentiment analysis is a challenging task that attracted increasing interest during the last years. The availability of online data along with the business interest to keep up with consumer feedback generates a constant demand for online analysis of user-generated content. A key role to this task plays the utilization of domain-specific lexicons of opinion words that enables algorithms to classify short snippets of text into sentiment classes (positive, negative). This process is known as dictionary-based sentiment analysis. The related work tends to solve this lexicon identification problem by either exploiting a corpus and a thesaurus or by manually defining a set of patterns that will extract opinion words. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for discovering patterns that will extract domain-specific dictionary. Our approach (DidaxTo) utilizes opinion modifiers, sentiment consistency theories, polarity …",0

Ensemble pruning using reinforcement learning,2006,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11752912_31,"Multiple Classifier systems have been developed in order to improve classification accuracy using methodologies for effective classifier combination. Classical approaches use heuristics, statistical tests, or a meta-learning level in order to find out the optimal combination function. We study this problem from a Reinforcement Learning perspective. In our modeling, an agent tries to learn the best policy for selecting classifiers by exploring a state space and considering a future cumulative reward from the environment. We evaluate our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art combination methods and obtain very promising results.",1

Mining domain-specific dictionaries of opinion words,2014,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11749-2_4,"The task of opinion mining has attracted interest during the last years. This is mainly due to the vast availability and value of opinions on-line and the easy access of data through conventional or intelligent crawlers. In order to utilize this information, algorithms make extensive use of word sets with known polarity. This approach is known as dictionary-based sentiment analysis. Such dictionaries are available for the English language. Unfortunately, this is not the case for other languages with smaller user bases. Moreover, such generic dictionaries are not suitable for specific domains. Domain-specific dictionaries are crucial for domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks. In this paper we alleviate the above issues by proposing an approach for domain-specific dictionary building. We evaluate our approach on a sentiment analysis task. Experiments on user reviews on digital devices demonstrate the utility of the …",0

User-centred privacy inference detection for smart home devices,0,http://ailab.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kounoudes_SmartWorld21.pdf,"In the smart home, vast amounts of data are being collected via various interconnected devices. Although this assists in improving the quality of life at home, often the user is not aware of the details concerning data collection apart from the information available on the provider privacy policy. It is however important to put the user inside this loop of information, so that she is well informed on possible uses of the data and the potential risks that this may entail. Previous works have identified user activity inside the smart home and have pointed out privacy threats. In this work, we go one step further by offering data inference techniques and giving this information back to the user. We use a number of machine learning techniques to draw conclusions about the user routines or activities and we inform the user about our findings concerning data inferences through a dedicated web application. Our aim is toward user-centred privacy and is a proof of concept that can be reused by smart home and Internet of Things service providers in general in order to improve the services offered to the end-users. Our results indicate that a large number of data inferences are possible by using a combination of techniques.",1
