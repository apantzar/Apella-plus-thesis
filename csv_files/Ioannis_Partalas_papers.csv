Results of the BioASQ tasks of the Question Answering Lab at CLEF 2015,2015,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01240400/,"The goal of the BioASQ challenge is to push research towards highly precise biomedical information access systems. We aim to promote systems and approaches that are able to deal with the whole diversity of the Web, especially for, but not restricted to, the context of bio-medicine. The third challenge consisted of two tasks: semantic indexing and question answering. 59 systems by 18 different teams participated in the semantic indexing task (Task 3a). The question answering task was further subdivided into two phases. 24 systems from 9 different teams participates in the annotation phase (Task 3b-phase A), while 26 systems of 10 different teams participated in the answer generation phase (Task 3b-phase B). Overall, the best systems were able to outperform the strong baselines provided by the organizers. In this paper, we present the data used during the challenge as well as the technologies which were used by the participants.",1
A study on greedy algorithms for ensemble pruning,2012,http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/publications/partalas-tr-2012.pdf,"Ensemble selection deals with the reduction of an ensemble of predictive models in order to improve its efficiency and predictive performance. A number of ensemble selection methods that are based on greedy search of the space of all possible ensemble subsets have recently been proposed. They use different directions for searching this space and different measures for evaluating the available actions at each state. Some use the training set for subset evaluation, while others a separate validation set. This paper abstracts the key points of these methods and offers a general framework of the greedy ensemble selection algorithm, discussing its important parameters and the different options for instantiating these parameters.",1
Transferring task models in reinforcement learning agents,2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231212007771,"The main objective of transfer learning is to reuse knowledge acquired in a previous learned task, in order to enhance the learning procedure in a new and more complex task. Transfer learning comprises a suitable solution for speeding up the learning procedure in Reinforcement Learning tasks. This work proposes a novel method for transferring models to Reinforcement Learning agents. The models of the transition and reward functions of a source task, will be transferred to a relevant but different target task. The learning algorithm of the target task's agent takes a hybrid approach, implementing both model-free and model-based learning, in order to fully exploit the presence of a source task model. Moreover, a novel method is proposed for transferring models of potential-based reward shaping functions.

Results of the First BioASQ Workshop,2013,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.403.1553&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"The goal of the BioASQ project is to push the research frontier towards hybrid information systems. We aim to promote systems and approaches that are able to deal with the whole diversity of the Web, especially for, but not restricted to the context of bio-medicine. This goal is pursued by the organization of challenges. The first challenge consisted of two tasks: semantic indexing and question answering. 157 systems were registered by 12 different participants for the semantic indexing task, of which between 19 and 29 participated in each batch. The question answering task was tackled by 15 systems, which were developed by three different organizations. Between 2 and 5 of these systems addressed each batch. Overall, the best systems were able to outperform the strong baselines provided in the experiments in two out of three settings. This suggests that advances over the state of the art were achieved through the BioASQ challenge but also that the benchmark in itself is very challenging. In this paper, we present the data used during the challenge as well as the technologies which were at the core of the participants’ frameworks.",1

Technology Overview Report 2,2014,http://bioasq.org/sites/default/files/PublicDocuments/BioASQ_D5.3-Technology_Overview_Report_2_final.pdf,"This deliverable reviews the systems that participated during the second B ASQ challenge and performs an analysis of the results. More specifically, in the deliverable a short description of each system is given providing also the key technologies that have been used. The objective of this deliverable is to identify the most promising approaches and to point out the progress made with the state-of-the-art. The challenge comprised two tasks: a) large-scale online biomedical indexing (Task 2a) and b) biomedical semantic QA (Task 2b). Both tasks run in five consecutive batches. In Task 2a 18 teams participated using 61 registered systems. The systems were evaluated in several performance measures and compared against two baseline systems. Most of them were able to cope with the large scale of the problem while three of them achieved to systematically outperform the state-of-the-art baseline (Medical Text Indexer). A variety of methods have been used like machine learning approaches or search-based ones and hierarchical or flat ones. Specifically, the best systems achieved to enlarge the margin of performance with the MTI system which also this year improved its performance. In Task 2b 8 teams participated in both phases of the task with a total of 15 systems. In both phases the systems were able to achieve good performances and in most cases to achieve better results than the baselines.",1

A hybrid multiagent reinforcement learning approach using strategies and fusion,2008,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218213008004230,"Reinforcement Learning comprises an attractive solution to the problem of coordinating a group of agents in a Multiagent System, due to its robustness for learning in uncertain and unknown environments. This paper proposes a multiagent Reinforcement Learning approach, that uses coordinated actions, which we call strategies and a fusing process to guide the agents. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments in the Predator-Prey domain and compare it with other learning techniques. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",1
On the effectiveness of feature set augmentation using clusters of word embeddings,2017,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01265,"Word clusters have been empirically shown to offer important performance improvements on various tasks. Despite their importance, their incorporation in the standard pipeline of feature engineering relies more on a trial-and-error procedure where one evaluates several hyper-parameters, like the number of clusters to be used. In order to better understand the role of such features we systematically evaluate their effect on four tasks, those of named entity segmentation and classification as well as, those of five-point sentiment classification and quantification. Our results strongly suggest that cluster membership features improve the performance.",1
Efficient model selection for regularized classification by exploiting unlabeled data,2015,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24465-5_3,"Hyper-parameter tuning is a resource-intensive task when optimizing classification models. The commonly used k-fold cross validation can become intractable in large scale settings when a classifier has to learn billions of parameters. At the same time, in real-world, one often encounters multi-class classification scenarios with only a few labeled examples; model selection approaches often offer little improvement in such cases and the default values of learners are used. We propose bounds for classification on accuracy and macro measures (precision, recall, F1) that motivate efficient schemes for model selection and can benefit from the existence of unlabeled data. We demonstrate the advantages of those schemes by comparing them with k-fold cross validation and hold-out estimation in the setting of large scale classification.",1

On flat versus hierarchical classification in large-scale taxonomies,2013,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01118815/,"We study in this paper flat and hierarchical classification strategies in the context of large-scale taxonomies. To this end, we first propose a multiclass, hierarchi-cal data dependent bound on the generalization error of classifiers deployed in large-scale taxonomies. This bound provides an explanation to several empirical results reported in the literature, related to the performance of flat and hierarchical classifiers. We then introduce another type of bound targeting the approximation error of a family of classifiers, and derive from it features used in a meta-classifier to decide which nodes to prune (or flatten) in a large-scale taxonomy. We finally illustrate the theoretical developments through several experiments conducted on two widely used taxonomies.",1

Transfer Learning in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Domains,2012,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-29946-9_25,"In the context of reinforcement learning, transfer learning refers to the concept of reusing knowledge acquired in past tasks to speed up the learning procedure in new tasks. Transfer learning methods have been succesfully applied in single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, but no prior work has focused on applying them in a multi-agent environment. We propose a novel method for transfer learning in multi-agent reinforcement learning domains. We proceed to test the proposed approach in a multi-agent domain under various configurations. The results demonstrate that the method can reduce the learning time and increase the asymptotic performance of the learning algorithm.",1
Ensemble pruning using reinforcement learning,2006,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11752912_31,"Multiple Classifier systems have been developed in order to improve classification accuracy using methodologies for effective classifier combination. Classical approaches use heuristics, statistical tests, or a meta-learning level in order to find out the optimal combination function. We study this problem from a Reinforcement Learning perspective. In our modeling, an agent tries to learn the best policy for selecting classifiers by exploring a state space and considering a future cumulative reward from the environment. We evaluate our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art combination methods and obtain very promising results.",1
Sparsification of linear models for large-scale text classification,2015,http://ama.liglab.fr/~amini/Publis/Sparsification_CAp15.pdf,In this paper we propose a simple yet effective method for sparsifying a posteriori linear models for large-scale text classification. The objective is to maintain high performance while reducing the prediction time by producing very sparse models. This is especially important in real-case scenarios where one deploys predictive models in several machines across the network and constraints apply on the prediction time. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach in a large collection of documents from the Large-Scale Hierarchical Text Classification Challenge. The comparison with a feature selection method and LASSO regularization shows that we achieve to obtain a sparse representation improving in the same time the classification performance.,1

Autonomous Selection of Inter-Task Mappings in Transfer Learning,2013,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS13/paper/viewPaper/5751,"When transferring knowledge between reinforcement learning agents with different state representations or actions, past knowledge must be efficiently mapped so that it assists learning. The majority of the existing approaches use pre-defined mappings given by a domain expert. To overcome this limitations and allow autonomous transfer learning, this paper introduces a method for weighting and using multiple inter-task mappings, named COMBREL. Experimental results show that the use of multiple inter-task mappings, accompanied with a selection mechanism, can significantly boost the performance of transfer learning, relative to learning without transfer and relative to using a single hand-picked mapping.",1
Transfer Learning via Multiple Inter-Task Mappings,2012,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-29946-9_23,"In this paper we investigate using multiple mappings for transfer learning in reinforcement learning tasks. We propose two different transfer learning algorithms that are able to manipulate multiple inter-task mappings for both model-learning and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. Both algorithms incorporate mechanisms to select the appropriate mappings, helping to avoid the phenomenon of negative transfer. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in the Mountain Car and Keepaway domains. Experimental results show that the use of multiple inter-task mappings can significantly boost the performance of transfer learning methodologies, relative to using a single mapping or learning without transfer.",1
Maximum-margin Framework for Training Data Synchronization in Large-scale Hierarchical Classification,2013,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-42054-2_42,"In the context of supervised learning, the training data for large-scale hierarchical classification consist of (i) a set of input-output pairs, and (ii) a hierarchy structure defining parent-child relation among class labels. It is often the case that the hierarchy structure given a-priori is not optimal for achieving high classification accuracy. This is especially true for web-taxonomies such as Yahoo! directory which consist of tens of thousand of classes. Furthermore, an important goal of hierarchy design is to render better navigability and browsing. In this work, we propose a maximum-margin framework for automatically adapting the given hierarchy by using the set of input-output pairs to yield a new hierarchy. The proposed method is not only theoretically justified but also provides a more principled approach for hierarchy flattening techniques proposed earlier, which are ad-hoc and empirical in nature. The empirical …",0
Learning to search for recognizing named entities in twitter,2016,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-3923.pdf,We presented in this work our participation in the 2nd Named Entity Recognition for Twitter shared task. The task has been cast as a sequence labeling one and we employed a learning to search approach in order to tackle it. We also leveraged LOD for extracting rich contextual features for the named-entities. Our submission achieved F-scores of 46.16 and 60.24 for the classification and the segmentation tasks and ranked 2nd and 3rd respectively. The post-analysis showed that LOD features improved substantially the performance of our system as they counter-balance the lack of context in tweets. The shared task gave us the opportunity to test the performance of NER systems in short and noisy textual data. The results of the participated systems shows that the task is far to be considered as a solved one and methods with stellar performance in normal texts need to be revised.,1
Cap 2017 challenge: Twitter named entity recognition,2017,https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07568,"The paper describes the CAp 2017 challenge. The challenge concerns the problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for tweets written in French. We first present the data preparation steps we followed for constructing the dataset released in the framework of the challenge. We begin by demonstrating why NER for tweets is a challenging problem especially when the number of entities increases. We detail the annotation process and the necessary decisions we made. We provide statistics on the inter-annotator agreement, and we conclude the data description part with examples and statistics for the data. We, then, describe the participation in the challenge, where 8 teams participated, with a focus on the methods employed by the challenge participants and the scores achieved in terms of F measure. Importantly, the constructed dataset comprising 6,000 tweets annotated for 13 types of entities, which to the best of our knowledge is the first such dataset in French, is publicly available at \url{http://cap2017.imag.fr/competition.html} .",1
Juggler: Multi-Stakeholder Ranking with Meta-Learning,2021,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2959/paper3.pdf,"Online marketplaces must optimize recommendations with regards to multiple objectives, in order to fulfill expectations from a variety of stakeholders. This problem is typically addressed using Pareto Theory, which explores multiple objectives in a domain and identifies the objective vectors which yield the best performance. However, such approach is computationally expensive, and available commonly only through domain-specific solutions, which is not ideal for online marketplaces and their ever-changing business dynamics. We tackle these limitations by proposing a Meta-Learning framework to address the Multi-Stakeholder recommendation problem, which is able to dynamically predict the ideal settings on how business rules should be mingled into the final recommendations. The framework is designed to be generic enough to be leveraged in any item ranking domain and requires only the definition of a policy, ie a set of multi-objective metrics the meta-model should optimize for. The model finds the mapping between the search context and the corresponding best objective vectors. This way, the model is able to predict in real-time which is the best solution for any unforeseen search, and therefore adapt the recommendations on a search-level. We show that under this framework, the range of models one is able to build depends only on how many policies can be defined, thus offering a virtually unlimited way to address multi-objective problems. The experimental results showcase the generalization abilities of this framework and its highly predictive performance. Furthermore, the simulation results confirm the ability to approximate a policy …",0
Wasserstein distances for evaluating cross-lingual embeddings,2019,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11005,Word embeddings are high dimensional vector representations of words that capture their semantic similarity in the vector space. There exist several algorithms for learning such embeddings both for a single language as well as for several languages jointly. In this work we propose to evaluate collections of embeddings by adapting downstream natural language tasks to the optimal transport framework. We show how the family of Wasserstein distances can be used to solve cross-lingual document retrieval and the cross-lingual document classification problems. We argue on the advantages of this approach compared to more traditional evaluation methods of embeddings like bilingual lexical induction. Our experimental results suggest that using Wasserstein distances on these problems out-performs several strong baselines and performs on par with state-of-the-art models.,1
Detecting influencial users in social networks: analysing graph-based and linguistic perspectives,2017,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29904-0_9,"There has been increasing interest in the artificial intelligence community for influencer detection in recent years for its utility in singling out pertinent users within a large network of social media users. This could be useful, for example in commercial campaigns, to promote a product or a brand to a relevant target set of users. This task is performed either by analysing the graph-based representation of user interactions in a social network or by measuring the impact of the linguistic content of user messages in online discussions. We performed independent studies for each of these methods in the present paper with a hybridisation perspective. In the first study, we extract structural information to highlight influence among interaction networks. In the second, we identify linguistic features of influential behaviours. We then compute a score of user influence using centrality measures with the structural information …",0

Aggressive sampling for multi-class to binary reduction with applications to text classification,2017,https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06511,"We address the problem of multi-class classification in the case where the number of classes is very large. We propose a double sampling strategy on top of a multi-class to binary reduction strategy, which transforms the original multi-class problem into a binary classification problem over pairs of examples. The aim of the sampling strategy is to overcome the curse of long-tailed class distributions exhibited in majority of large-scale multi-class classification problems and to reduce the number of pairs of examples in the expanded data. We show that this strategy does not alter the consistency of the empirical risk minimization principle defined over the double sample reduction. Experiments are carried out on DMOZ and Wikipedia collections with 10,000 to 100,000 classes where we show the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of training and prediction time, memory consumption, and predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.",1

Transferring Evolved Reservoir Features in Reinforcement Learning Tasks,2012,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-29946-9_22,"The major goal of transfer learning is to transfer knowledge acquired on a source task in order to facilitate learning on another, different, but usually related, target task. In this paper, we are using neuroevolution to evolve echo state networks on the source task and transfer the best performing reservoirs to be used as initial population on the target task. The idea is that any non-linear, temporal features, represented by the neurons of the reservoir and evolved on the source task, along with reservoir properties, will be a good starting point for a stochastic search on the target task. In a step towards full autonomy and by taking advantage of the random and fully connected nature of echo state networks, we examine a transfer method that renders any inter-task mappings of states and actions unnecessary. We tested our approach and that of inter-task mappings in two RL testbeds: the mountain car and the server …",0
Re-ranking approach to classification in large-scale power-law distributed category systems,2014,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2600428.2609509,"For large-scale category systems, such as Directory Mozilla, which consist of tens of thousand categories, it has been empirically verified in earlier studies that the distribution of documents among categories can be modeled as a power-law distribution. It implies that a significant fraction of categories, referred to as rare categories, have very few documents assigned to them. This characteristic of the data makes it harder for learning algorithms to learn effective decision boundaries which can correctly detect such categories in the test set. In this work, we exploit the distribution of documents among categories to (i) derive an upper bound on the accuracy of any classifier, and (ii) propose a ranking-based algorithm which aims to maximize this upper bound. The empirical evaluation on publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves higher accuracy but also much higher …",0
Transferring experience in reinforcement learning through task decomposition.,2009,https://www.academia.edu/download/39820865/Transferring_experience_in_reinforcement20151109-10836-105lda4.pdf,"Transfer learning refers to the process of conveying experience from a simple task to another more complex (and related) task in order to reduce the amount of time that is required to learn the latter task. Typically, in a transfer learning procedure the agent learns a behavior in a source task, and it uses the gained knowledge in order to speed up the learning process in a target task. Reinforcement Learning algorithms are time expensive when they learn from scratch, especially in complex domains, and transfer learning comprises a suitable solution to speed up the training process. In this work we propose a method that decomposes the target task in several instances of the source task and uses them to extract an adviced action for the target task.

Aligning Hotel Embeddings using Domain Adaptation for Next-Item Recommendation,2021,https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13824,"In online platforms it is often the case to have multiple brands under the same group which may target different customer profiles, or have different domains. For example, in the hospitality domain, Expedia Group has multiple brands like Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and Wotif which have either different traveler profiles or are more relevant in a local context. In this context, learning embeddings for hotels that can be leveraged in recommendation tasks in multiple brands requires to have a common embedding that can be induced using alignment approaches. In the same time, one needs to ensure that this common embedding space does not degrade the performance in any of the brands. In this work we build upon the hotel2vec model and propose a simple regularization approach for aligning hotel embeddings of different brands via domain adaptation. We also explore alignment methods previously used in cross-lingual embeddings to align spaces of different languages. We present results on the task of next-hotel prediction using click sessions from two brands. The results show that the proposed approach can align the two embedding spaces while achieving good performance in both brands. Additionally, with respect to single-brand training we show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce training time and improve the predictive performance.",1

We followed a text classification approach employing mainly linear models. The final solution was a weighted voting system which combined a variety of trained models.,1
Adaptive classifier selection in large-scale hierarchical classification,2012,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34487-9_74,"Going beyond the traditional text classification, involving a few tens of classes, there has been a surge of interest in automatic document categorization in large taxonomies where the number of classes range from hundreds of thousands to millions. Due to the complex nature of the learning problem posed in such scenarios, one needs to adapt the conventional classification schemes to suit this domain. This paper presents a novel approach for classifier selection in large hierarchies, which is based on exploiting training data heterogeneity across the hierarchy. We also present a meta-learning framework for further flexibility in classifier selection. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our approach, which achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art and is also significantly faster for prediction.",1
Comparing Named-Entity Recognizers in a Targeted Domain: Handcrafted Rules vs Machine Learning,2016,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2016.jeptalnrecital-poster.10/,"Comparing Named-Entity Recognizers in a Targeted Domain: Handcrafted Rules vs. Machine Learning Named-Entity Recognition concerns the classification of textual objects in a predefined set of categories such as persons, organizations, and localizations. While Named-Entity Recognition is well studied since 20 years, the application to specialized domains still poses challenges for current systems. We developed a rule-based system and two machine learning approaches to tackle the same task: recognition of product names, brand names, etc., in the domain of Cosmetics, for French. Our systems can thus be compared under ideal conditions. In this paper, we introduce both systems and we compare them.",1
Comparative Classifier Evaluation for Web-scale Taxonomies using Power Law,2013,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-41242-4_56,"In the context of web-scale taxonomies such as Directory Mozilla(                                        www.dmoz.org                                                       ), previous works have shown the existence of power law distribution in the size of the categories for every level in the taxonomy.

On empirical tradeoffs in large scale hierarchical classification,2012,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2396761.2398625,"While multi-class categorization of documents has been of research interest for over a decade, relatively fewer approaches have been proposed for large scale taxonomies in which the number of classes range from hundreds of thousand as in Directory Mozilla to over a million in Wikipedia. As a result of ever increasing number of text documents and images from various sources, there is an immense need for automatic classification of documents in such large hierarchies. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoffs between the important characteristics of different classifiers employed in the top down fashion. The properties for relative comparison of these classifiers include,(i) accuracy on test instance,(ii) training time (iii) size of the model and (iv) test time required for prediction. Our analysis is motivated by the well known error bounds from learning theory, which is also further reinforced by the empirical observations on …",0

An overview of the BIOASQ large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering competition,2015,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0564-6,"This article provides an overview of the first BioASQ challenge, a competition on large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering (QA), which took place between March and September 2013. BioASQ assesses the ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical scientific articles, and to return concise and user-understandable answers to given natural language questions by combining information from biomedical articles and ontologies. The 2013 BioASQ competition comprised two tasks, Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were asked to automatically annotate new PubMed documents with MeSH headings. Twelve teams participated in Task 1a, with a total of 46 system runs submitted, and one of the teams performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used by NLM to suggest MeSH headings to curators. Task 1b used benchmark datasets containing 29 development and 282 test English questions, along with gold standard (reference) answers, prepared by a team of biomedical experts from around Europe and participants had to automatically produce answers. Three teams participated in Task 1b, with 11 system runs. The BioASQ infrastructure, including benchmark datasets, evaluation mechanisms, and the results of the participants and baseline methods, is publicly available. A publicly available evaluation infrastructure for biomedical semantic indexing and QA has been developed, which includes benchmark datasets, and can be used to evaluate systems that: assign MeSH headings to published articles or to English questions; retrieve relevant RDF triples from ontologies, relevant …",0

An ensemble pruning primer,2009,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03999-7_1,Ensemble pruning deals with the reduction of an ensemble of predictive models in order to improve its efficiency and predictive performance. The last 12 years a large number of ensemble pruning methods have been proposed. This work proposes a taxonomy for their organization and reviews important representative methods of each category.

An ensemble uncertainty aware measure for directed hill climbing ensemble pruning,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-010-5172-0,"This paper proposes a new measure for ensemble pruning via directed hill climbing, dubbed Uncertainty Weighted Accuracy (UWA), which takes into account the uncertainty of the decision of the current ensemble. Empirical results on 30 data sets show that using the proposed measure to prune a heterogeneous ensemble leads to significantly better accuracy results compared to state-of-the-art measures and other baseline methods, while keeping only a small fraction of the original models. Besides the evaluation measure, the paper also studies two other parameters of directed hill climbing ensemble pruning methods, the search direction and the evaluation dataset, with interesting conclusions on appropriate values.",1
Learning taxonomy adaptation in large-scale classification,2016,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-207/14-207.pdf,"In this paper, we study flat and hierarchical classification strategies in the context of largescale taxonomies. Addressing the problem from a learning-theoretic point of view, we first propose a multi-class, hierarchical data dependent bound on the generalization error of classifiers deployed in large-scale taxonomies. This bound provides an explanation to several empirical results reported in the literature, related to the performance of flat and hierarchical classifiers. Based on this bound, we also propose a technique for modifying a given taxonomy through pruning, that leads to a lower value of the upper bound as compared to the original taxonomy. We then present another method for hierarchy pruning by studying approximation error of a family of classifiers, and derive from it features used in a meta-classifier to decide which nodes to prune. We finally illustrate the theoretical developments through several experiments conducted on two widely used taxonomies.",1
On power law distributions in large-scale taxonomies,2014,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2674026.2674033,"In many of the large-scale physical and social complex systems phenomena fat-tailed distributions occur, for which different generating mechanisms have been proposed. In this paper, we study models of generating power law distributions in the evolution of large-scale taxonomies such as Open Directory Project, which consist of websites assigned to one of tens of thousands of categories. The categories in such taxonomies are arranged in tree or DAG structured configurations having parent-child relations among them. We first quantitatively analyse the formation process of such taxonomies, which leads to power law distribution as the stationary distributions. In the context of designing classifiers for large-scale taxonomies, which automatically assign unseen documents to leaf-level categories, we highlight how the fat-tailed nature of these distributions can be leveraged to analytically study the space complexity of …",0

Multi-agent reinforcement learning using strategies and voting,2007,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4410398/,"Multiagent learning attracts much attention in the past few years as it poses very challenging problems. Reinforcement Learning is an appealing solution to the problems that arise to Multi Agent Systems (MASs). This is due to the fact that Reinforcement Learning is a robust and well suited technique for learning in MASs. This paper proposes a multi-agent Reinforcement Learning approach, that uses coordinated actions, which we call strategies and a voting process that combines the decisions of the agents, in order to follow a strategy. We performed experiments to the predator-prey domain, comparing our approach with other multi-agent Reinforcement Learning techniques, getting promising results.",1
Reinforcement learning with classifier selection for focused crawling,2008,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/4486,"Focused crawlers are programs that wander in the Web, using its graph structure, and gather pages that belong to a specific topic. The most critical task in Focused Crawling is the scoring of the URLs as it designates the path that the crawler will follow, and thus its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel scheme for assigning scores to the URLs, based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. The proposed approach learns to select the best classifier for ordering the URLs. This formulation reduces the size of the search space for the RL method and makes the problem tractable. We evaluate the proposed approach on-line on a number of topics, which offers a realistic view of its performance, comparing it also with a RL method and a simple but effective classifier-based crawler. The results demonstrate the strength of the proposed approach.",1
Transfer learning with probabilistic mapping selection,2015,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1059712314559525,"When transferring knowledge between reinforcement learning agents with different state representations or actions, past knowledge must be efficiently mapped to novel tasks so that it aids learning. The majority of the existing approaches use pre-defined mappings provided by a domain expert. To overcome this limitation and enable autonomous transfer learning, this paper introduces a method for weighting and using multiple inter-task mappings based on a probabilistic framework. Experimental results show that the use of multiple inter-task mappings, accompanied with a probabilistic selection mechanism, can significantly boost the performance of transfer learning relative to 1) learning without transfer and 2) using a single hand-picked mapping. We especially introduce novel tasks for transfer learning in a realistic simulation of the iCub robot, demonstrating the ability of the method to select mappings in complex …",0

Hotel2vec: Learning Attribute-Aware Hotel Embeddings with Self-Supervision,2019,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03943,"We propose a neural network architecture for learning vector representations of hotels. Unlike previous works, which typically only use user click information for learning item embeddings, we propose a framework that combines several sources of data, including user clicks, hotel attributes (e.g., property type, star rating, average user rating), amenity information (e.g., the hotel has free Wi-Fi or free breakfast), and geographic information. During model training, a joint embedding is learned from all of the above information. We show that including structured attributes about hotels enables us to make better predictions in a downstream task than when we rely exclusively on click data. We train our embedding model on more than 40 million user click sessions from a leading online travel platform and learn embeddings for more than one million hotels. Our final learned embeddings integrate distinct sub-embeddings for user clicks, hotel attributes, and geographic information, providing an interpretable representation that can be used flexibly depending on the application. We show empirically that our model generates high-quality representations that boost the performance of a hotel recommendation system in addition to other applications. An important advantage of the proposed neural model is that it addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes which are available for all hotels.",1

Evaluation Measures for Hierarchical Classification: a unified view and novel approaches,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-014-0382-x,"Hierarchical classification addresses the problem of classifying items into a hierarchy of classes. An important issue in hierarchical classification is the evaluation of different classification algorithms, an issue which is complicated by the hierarchical relations among the classes. Several evaluation measures have been proposed for hierarchical classification using the hierarchy in different ways without however providing a unified view of the problem. This paper studies the problem of evaluation in hierarchical classification by analysing and abstracting the key components of the existing performance measures.
