Spaceland embedding of sparse stochastic graphs,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8916505/,"We introduce SG-t-SNE, a nonlinear method for embedding stochastic graphs/networks into d-dimensional spaces, d = 1, 2, 3, without requiring vertex features to reside in, or be transformed into, a metric space. Graphs/networks are relational data, prevalent in real-world applications. Graph embedding is fundamental to many graph analysis tasks, besides graph visualization. SG-t-SNE follows and builds upon the core principle of t-SNE, which is a widely used method for visualizing high-dimensional data. We also introduce SG-t-SNE-Π, a high-performance software for rapid d-dimensional embedding of large, sparse, stochastic graphs on personal computers with superior efficiency. It empowers SG-t-SNE with modern computing techniques exploiting matrix structures in tandem with memory architectures. We present elucidating graph embedding results with several synthetic graphs and real-world networks in this …",0
Fast graphlet transform of sparse graphs,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9286205/,"We introduce the computational problem of graphlet transform of a sparse graph. Graphlets are fundamental topology elements of all graphs/networks. They can be used as coding elements to encode graph-topological information at multiple granularity levels, for classifying vertices on the same graph/network, as well as, for making differentiation or connection across different networks. Network/graph analysis using graphlets has growing applications. We recognize the universality and increased encoding capacity in using multiple graphlets, we address the arising computational complexity issues, and we present a fast method for exact graphlet transform. The fast graphlet transform establishes a few remarkable records at once in high computational efficiency, low memory consumption, and ready translation to high-performance program and implementation. It is intended to enable and advance network/graph …",0
SG-t-SNE-Π: Swift Neighbor Embedding of Sparse Stochastic Graphs,2019,https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01577.pdf,"SG-t-SNE-Π is a high-performance software for swift embedding of a large, sparse, stochastic graph/network into a d-dimensional space (d= 1, 2, 3) on a shared-memory computer, especially on personal laptop and desktop computers. Graphs/networks are an important type of relational data, arising ubiquitously in real-world applications and various research fields. Such data include biological networks, social networks, communication networks, food webs, word co-occurrence networks, see Kovács et al.(2019) and Yang & Leskovec (2015) for more real-world networks. Graph embedding maps each vertex of the graph to a d-dimensional feature vector. Graph embedding into a d-dimensional space with d= 1, 2, 3 is frequently used in data-based scientific studies for visual inspection of data, interpretation of network-based analysis results, interactive inquiries and hypothesis generation.The software SG-t-SNE-Π and its underlying algorithm are built upon precursor algorithms and software for stochastic neighbor embedding of high-dimensional data, namely the original Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithm by Hinton & Roweis (2003), the algorithm for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) by van der Maaten & Hinton (2008), and their variants (Linderman, Rachh, Hoskins, Steinerberger, & Kluger, 2019; van der Maaten, 2014). 12 The t-SNE algorithm has successfully assisted scientific discoveries, as reported in numerous articles in Nature and Science magazines. However, previous t-SNE algorithms and software are limited in two aspects:(i) The algorithms require that the data points be in a metric space and the …",0
The Beneficial Effect of the Mobile Application Euglyca in Children and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2019,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/dia.2019.0170,"Background: Euglyca® is a mobile application which we developed for children and adolescents suffering type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for calculation of the appropriate insulin bolus dose by importing in the equation carbohydrates, lipids, glucose levels, and personalized parameters.

Remote Monitoring of Pregnancies Complicated by Gestational Diabetes Mellitus during the COVID-19,2021,http://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/327861,"Background: During the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece we used our application STORK, to monitor pregnancies complicated by Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). STORK was originally developed to predict complications in pregnancy using medical records and daily life measurements. Objective: Aim of the present study was to assess the compliance of women with the application and its efficacy in reducing the number and the duration of visits. Methods: STORK was provided in all women with GDM visiting our outpatient department between February and June 2020. All women were asked to use the application daily imputing their blood glucose measurements, blood pressure measurements, results of blood tests and reports of fetal ultrasounds. The attending physicians had direct access to those data. The number and the duration of visits for each pregnant woman was noted. In addition, the number and the …",0
Robust Automatic Co-Segmentation of Multiple Medical Images,2017,https://users.cs.duke.edu/~tcliu/publication/AAPM-2017/AAPM2017-Coseg-abstract.pdf,"Purpose: Automatic segmentation is very valuable for computer aided diagnosis and contouring during radiotherapy planning. When dealing with multiple image sets, such as the different respiratory phases in 4D-CT data, simultaneous co-segmentation of multiple medical images can be very useful for improving the efficiency and accuracy of segmentation and structure tracking. This work aims to develop a robust automatic co-segmentation method by adopting and adapting co-segmentation methods developed by the computer vision community for (RGB) video editing, tracking and understanding to medical image processing.Methods: The presented method takes into account typical properties of medical images: gray scale, various fine tissue, low contrast, multiple noises, and higher spatial dimensions such as 4D-CT images, that challenge cosegmentation methods in robustness and efficiency. We adopt the …",0

Rapid Near-Neighbor Interaction of High-dimensional Data via Hierarchical Clustering,2017,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03671,"Calculation of near-neighbor interactions among high dimensional, irregularly distributed data points is a fundamental task to many graph-based or kernel-based machine learning algorithms and applications. Such calculations, involving large, sparse interaction matrices, expose the limitation of conventional data-and-computation reordering techniques for improving space and time locality on modern computer memory hierarchies. We introduce a novel method for obtaining a matrix permutation that renders a desirable sparsity profile. The method is distinguished by the guiding principle to obtain a profile that is block-sparse with dense blocks. Our profile model and measure capture the essential properties affecting space and time locality, and permit variation in sparsity profile without imposing a restriction to a fixed pattern. The second distinction lies in an efficient algorithm for obtaining a desirable profile, via exploring and exploiting multi-scale cluster structure hidden in but intrinsic to the data. The algorithm accomplishes its task with key components for lower-dimensional embedding with data-specific principal feature axes, hierarchical data clustering, multi-level matrix compression storage, and multi-level interaction computations. We provide experimental results from case studies with two important data analysis algorithms. The resulting performance is remarkably comparable to the BLAS performance for the best-case interaction governed by a regularly banded matrix with the same sparsity.",1
A systematic association of subgraph counts over a network,2021,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10838,"We associate all small subgraph counting problems with a systematic graph encoding/representation system which makes a coherent use of graphlet structures. The system can serve as a unified foundation for studying and connecting many important graph problems in theory and practice. We describe topological relations among graphlets (graph elements) in rigorous mathematics language and from the perspective of graph encoding. We uncover, characterize and utilize algebraic and numerical relations in graphlet counts/frequencies. We present a novel algorithm for efficiently counting small subgraphs as a practical product of our theoretical findings.",1

Using graphlet spectrograms for temporal pattern analysis of virus-research collaboration networks,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9286161/,"We introduce a new method for temporal pattern analysis of scientific collaboration networks. We investigate in particular virus research activities through five epidemic or pandemic outbreaks in the recent two decades and in the ongoing pandemic with COVID-19. Our method embodies two innovative components. The first is a simple model of temporal collaboration networks with time segmented in publication time and convolved in citation history, to effectively capture and accommodate collaboration activities at mixed time scales. The second component is the novel use of graphlets to encode topological structures and to detect change and persistence in collaboration activities over time. We discover in particular two unique and universal roles of bi-fork graphlet in (1) identifying bridges among triangle clusters and (2) quantifying grassroots as the backbone of every collaboration network. We present a number of …",0
Sparse Dual of the Density Peaks Algorithm for Cluster Analysis of High-dimensional Data,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8547519/,"The density peaks (DP) algorithm for cluster analysis, introduced by Rodriguez and Laio in 2014, has proven empirically competitive or superior in multiple aspects to other contemporary clustering algorithms. Yet, it suffers from certain drawbacks and limitations when used for clustering high-dimensional data. We introduce SD-DP, the sparse dual version of DP. While following the DP principle and maintaining its appealing properties, we find and use a sparse descriptor of local density as a robust representation. By analyzing and exploiting the consequential properties, we are able to use sparse graph-matrix expressions and operations throughout the clustering process. As a result, SD-DP has provably linear-scaling computation complexity under practical conditions. We show with experimental results on several real-world high-dimensional datasets, that SD-DP outperforms DP in robustness, accuracy, self …",0
