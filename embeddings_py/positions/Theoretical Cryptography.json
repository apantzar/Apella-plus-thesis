    "description": "Theoretical cryptography is the development of cryptographic schemes based on intractable algorithmic problems of number theory, as well as cryptanalytical methods which consist in the algorithmic solution of such problems. Computational number theory is the algorithmic solution of number theory problems such as factorization, problem of discrete logarithm, etc. which are used in modern cryptographic schemes (RSA, Diffie-Hellman) as well as more generally quantitative estimates such as barriers to solutions of families of Diophantine equations, calculation of first special form, calculation of periods of retrospective sequences, etc.",
