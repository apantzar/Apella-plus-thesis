  "title": "Theoretical Cryptography",
  "description": "Theoretical Cryptography is the development of cryptographical schemes based on difficult to solve algorithmic problems of number theory, as well ascryptanalytic methods for algorithmic solutions on such problems. Computational number theory is the algorithmic number theory problems solution such asfactorisation, discrete logarithm problem, etc, which are used on modern cryptography schemes (RSA, Diffie-Hellman), while also quantity estimations in general,such as bounds for family solutions of diophantine equations, special form primes calculation, recursive sequences period calculations",
